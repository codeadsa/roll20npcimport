Special Abilities
Command Ghouls (Su) A dread ghoul can automatically command all normal ghouls within
30 feet as a free action. Normal ghouls never attack a dread ghoul unless compelled.
Create Spawn (Su) Any creature killed by a dread ghoul and lying undisturbed until the next
midnight rises as a dread ghoul at that time. The new dread ghoul is not under the control of its
creator. A protection from evil or gentle repose spell cast on the corpse prevents this.
Paralysis (Ex) A creature damaged by a dread ghoul’s bite or claw must make a DC 14 Fortitude
save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
