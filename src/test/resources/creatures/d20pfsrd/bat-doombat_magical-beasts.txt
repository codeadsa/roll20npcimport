SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shriek (Ex) A doombat can emit a piercing shriek every 1d4 rounds. All creatures that can hear the doombat’s shriek (except other doombats) within a 100-ft. radius must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Successive shrieks do not stack with each other but do extend the duration of the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same doombat’s shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Yip (Ex) A doombat yips constantly while in combat. The noise interferes with an opponent’s ability to focus on difficult tasks. Spellcasters within 100 ft. of a yipping doombat must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 + spell’s level) anytime they attempt to cast a spell. The effect of several doombats yipping at once is not cumulative.
