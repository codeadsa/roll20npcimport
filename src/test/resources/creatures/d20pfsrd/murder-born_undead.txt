SPECIAL ABILITIES
Despondent Wail (Su) As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn’s despondent wail for the next 24 hours.
Sense Living (Su) A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 8th) except it detects the presence of life rather than a particular alignment. There is no chance the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any other material.
