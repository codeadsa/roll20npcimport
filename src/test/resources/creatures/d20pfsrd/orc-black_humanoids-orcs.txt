TACTICS
Black orcs have a decent understanding of tactics. They are adept in the use of reach weapons such as longspears and glaives. Many of their number are proficient in the use of light crossbows. In melee they prefer to gang up on powerful opponents and dispatch them quickly before moving on to lesser foes whenever possible. As they are often led by clerics and necromancers in the service of Orcus, they are likely to take prisoners if possible with the intent of sacrificing them to the Demon Lord of Undead at some future time.
