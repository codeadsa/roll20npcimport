SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chill Touch (Su) Damage caused by the groaning spirit’s touch attack is considered negative energy and sends a chilling cold through an opponent’s body. Any creature touched must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of Strength drain. Groaning spirits are the bane of other undead, and any undead they touch (except other groaning spirits) must succeed on a DC 19 W ill save or flee in fear for 2d6 rounds. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Keening (Su) Once per day, at night only, a groaning spirit can release a death wail audible to a range of 1 mile. All creatures within 30 feet that hear this must make a successful DC 21 Will save or be affected as per the wail of the banshee spell. Those that make their save still take 3d6+7 points of damage. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the groaning spirit’s Ability Focus feat.
Lifesense (Su) A groaning spirit can sense all living creatures up to 5 miles away.
Vulnerability to Dispel Evil (Ex) If a dispel evil spell (the second effect requiring a touch attack) is used against a groaning spirit the creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + caster’s relevant ability score modifier) or be destroyed immediately.
