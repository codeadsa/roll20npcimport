SPECIAL ABILITIES
Astral Recoil (Su) As a full-round action, a shulsaga that touches a silver cord (such as that created by the spell astral projection) can cause the cord to recoil. The astral projecting creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be snapped back to its body, ending the spell effect but not harming the spellcaster. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Disk Rider (Su) A shulsaga can only use its fly speed in tandem with its floating disk spell-like ability. A shulsaga that casts floating disk can use the spell to its normal effect, or step upon it and use it to fly for the duration of the spell. The disk can support its creator and the creator’s equipment (even if this exceeds the load a floating disk can normally bear), but nothing else. Only the disk’s caster can ride it in this way. A floating disk cast by a shulsaga is dismissible.
Sense Rift (Su) As a standard action, a shulsaga can detect any planar rift within 20 miles, automatically learning its direction and distance. This includes natural portals, non-instantaneous planar spells such as gate, and other tears in reality.
