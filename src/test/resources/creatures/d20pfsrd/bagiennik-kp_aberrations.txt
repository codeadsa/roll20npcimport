SPECIAL ABILITIES
First Aid (Su) A bagiennik’s spell-like abilities arise from the application of its oily secretions. To use these abilities, a bagiennik must smear a small amount of its secretion on the wounded creature. The benefits come with a drawback, however, as any creature treated by a bagiennik’s healing is slowed for 1 minute if it fails a DC 16 Fortitude save (Con-based).
Oily Spray (Ex) A bagiennik can project a stream of dark oily substance from its nostrils. This burning substance inflicts half fire damage and half acid damage. Additionally, any creature struck by this stream must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save (Con-based) or fall prone in the slick oil.
