SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ethereal Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 13, frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1d4 Str, cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
A victim that reaches Strength 0 from an ethereal rat’s poisonous bite becomes ethereal (as if affected by the etherealness spell). The victim remains in this state until at least 1 point of Strength damage is healed.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su) An ethereal rat can shift from the Ethereal to the Material Plane as a swift action and shift back again as a move action. The ability is otherwise identical with ethereal jaunt (caster level 15th).
