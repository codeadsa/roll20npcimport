TACTICS
A witch tree sits unmoving until a potential target moves within range. It first attacks using its spell-like abilities, attempting to charm or control its would-be assailants. Those that resist are attacked physically by the witch tree. A grabbed opponent is held until it escapes or dies or until the witch tree is killed.
