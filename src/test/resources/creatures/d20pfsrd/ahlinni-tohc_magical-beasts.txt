SPECIAL ABILITIES
Birdsong (Su) An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet of the ahlinni. In these cases, this ability functions as speak with animals (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Impale (Ex) When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals double damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.
