SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ambush (Ex) If a tazelwurm catches an opponent flatfooted it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its attack roll for that round.
Frightening Exuviation (Ex) If a tazelwurm is hit by a fire attack or effect that deals at least 10 points of damage, it takes no damage, but instead allows its scales, flesh, and fur to be consumed and burned away in a single round, exposing its skeletal structure. A creature viewing this must make a successful DC 15 Will save or paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same tazelwurm’s frightening exuviation for one day. This has no effect on other tazelwurms.
