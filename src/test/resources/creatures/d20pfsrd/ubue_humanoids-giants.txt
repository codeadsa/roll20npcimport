SPECIAL ABILITIES
Multiple Personalities (Ex) The three heads of an ubue rarely get along with each other. Due to this division of personalities, there is a 15% chance in any given situation (usually once per encounter) that the heads get into an argument. An ubue engaged in an argument with itself takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, Reflex saves, and to AC for the duration of the encounter, or until they can reach some sort of accord.
In a non-combat situation, an opponent can coerce an ubue into a self-argument by making a Charisma check opposed by the ubue’s Wisdom check. If the ubue wins the opposed check, the character cannot attempt to coerce that ubue again for one day.
Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex) An ubue fights with a club in each of its three hands. Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with three weapons.
