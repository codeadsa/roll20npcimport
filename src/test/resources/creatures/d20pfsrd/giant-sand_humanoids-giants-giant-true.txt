SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fist of Sand (Su) Once per day as a move action, a sand giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a clenched fist. The arm is Huge and has a space of 15 ft. and a reach of 20 ft. The arm and fist cannot move from the location where it was created.
The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant’s turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant’s Hit Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target or adapt a new tactic as a free action.
The arm’s base attack bonus is equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of the fist of sand.
The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, –2 size) and has hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant that created it. It has a Strength score of 30. The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand giant dies.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex) Sand giants are automatically proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.
