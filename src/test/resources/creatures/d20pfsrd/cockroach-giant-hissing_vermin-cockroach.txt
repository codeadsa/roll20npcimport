SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fighting Hiss (Ex) As a free action, a monstrous cockroach or cockroach swarm can make a loud hissing noise by forcing air through the breathing pores on its abdomen. This sound can be extremely disconcerting, and any creature within 20 feet with Hit Dice equal to or lower than the cockroach’s must make a DC 14 Will save or be shaken until outside the hiss’s area of effect. This is a sonic attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.
