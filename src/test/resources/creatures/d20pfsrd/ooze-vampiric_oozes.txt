SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a vampiric ooze becomes a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the vampiric ooze that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex) Exposing a vampiric ooze to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round, and it is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape.
