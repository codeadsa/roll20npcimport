SPECIAL ABILITIES
Brain Static (Su) While within 30 feet of a cerebric cyst, creatures take a –2 penalty on all saves against the cerebric cyst’s attacks, spells, and other abilities. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Empowering Strike (Su) When a cerebric cyst hits a target creature with a tentacle attack, after resolving the damage it can, as a swift action, use one of its spell-like abilities without provoking attacks of opportunity.
Prescience (Su) A cerebric cyst’s limited precognitive ability grants it a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks, on Reflex saves, and to Armor Class. Cerebric cysts are never surprised or flat-footed.
Psychic Sting (Su) Creatures hit by a cerebric cyst’s tentacle must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of Intelligence damage. When a cerebric cyst deals Intelligence damage, it regains 1d6 hit points. This attack deals twice as much Intelligence damage and heals the cerebric cyst of twice as much damage if the victim can cast psychic spells (including by virtue of possessing the psychic magic universal monster ability) or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat. The save DC is Constitution-based.
