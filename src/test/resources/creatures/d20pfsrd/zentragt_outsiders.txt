SPECIAL ABILITIES
Adamantine Attacks (Ex) A zentragt’s bite and claw attacks count as adamantine, chaotic, and magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
Eat Metal (Su) A zentragt can eat metal to heal itself.
For every 5 pounds of iron or steel it consumes, it heals 5 hit points. Adamantine, cold iron, mithral, or metals with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher heal it double this amount. It takes a zentragt 1 minute to eat 5 pounds of metal.
