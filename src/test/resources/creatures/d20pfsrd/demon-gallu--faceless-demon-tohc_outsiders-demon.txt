SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alter Shape (Su) A gallu-demon can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. This ability is similar to the alter self spell (CL18th), but the gallu-demon can remain in the new form indefinitely.
Dimension Door (Su) At the gallu-demon’s option, it can use dimension door to transport a grappled victim (who gets no saving throw) within the same plane, instead of its plane shift ability. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.
Plane Shift (Su) A gallu-demon can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Abyss. This ability transports the gallu-demon and one grappled victim (who gets no save to avoid the shift). It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.
