SPECIAL ABILITIES
Icy Aura (Su) Misty vapors roil from the Black Rider to a distance of 10 feet. Any creatures in contact with the vapors must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the slow spell. Once affected, the creature remains slowed as long as it is in the aura and for 1 round afterward. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Rider’s Robes (Su) The Black Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as full plate armor.
Rider’s Weapon (Su) Whenever the Black Rider successfully confirms a critical hit with his +2 icy burst spear, the target is stunned for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
