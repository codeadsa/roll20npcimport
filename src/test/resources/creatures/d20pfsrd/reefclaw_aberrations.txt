SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Frenzy (Su) When a reefclaw is killed, its body spasms horrifically. Immediately upon dying, the reefclaw makes a full attack against a creature it threatens. If more than one creature is within reach, roll randomly for each attack to determine the target (which may be another reefclaw).
Grab (Ex) A reefclaw can use its grab ability on a target of any size. Reefclaws have a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks; this bonus replaces the normal +4 bonus a creature with grab receives.
Poison (Ex) Claw—injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
