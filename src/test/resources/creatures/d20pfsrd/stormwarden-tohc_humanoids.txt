SPECIAL ABILITIES
Conjure Storm (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a stormwarden can create an effect similar to a control weather spell (caster level 10th), except that it affects an area in a 1,000-foot-radius circle, and the weather effects are immediate rather than gradual. The effects last for 1 minute before the weather in the area returns to normal.
Stormwarden Characters Stormwardens favor nature-oriented classes, such as druid and ranger. They do not worship a single deity above all others, though they do tend to favor deities of storms and destruction. Though relatively few in number, stormwarden witches have a reputation of being some of the blackest and most vile practitioners of that art.
