SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus which covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. Slimy mucus covers three squares with the effects of a grease spell. Sticky mucus covers the squares with the effects of a web spell. Both effects are DC 14. The saves are Constitution based. Flail snails are immune to this mucus. Both types of mucus can be burned away as per the web spell.
Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.
Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.
Suction (Ex) A snail’s foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even on perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance to fall off unless the foot is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.
Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.
1d10 Result
1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells.
4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on him.
7-9 Spell fails; nothing happens.
10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning).
