SQ agile grappler
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agile Grappler (Ex) A gylou does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe.
Tentacle Cage (Su) If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature into her lower body’s nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow whole. The gylou’s tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou’s tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.
