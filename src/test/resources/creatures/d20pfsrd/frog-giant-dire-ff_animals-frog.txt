SPECIAL ABILITIES
Tongue (Ex) A giant dire frog’s tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the frog’s normal reach (30 ft. for a Large giant dire frog). A giant dire frog’s tongue deals no damage on a hit but can be used to grab. A giant dire frog does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.
