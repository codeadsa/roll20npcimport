SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A robot golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the golem gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves on to spread more destruction. The golem comes back under the control of its creator when the duration ends. A transmute metal to wood spell reduces the robot golem’s damage reduction by 5 and its natural armor bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds. A robot golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell. Rend Construct (Ex) This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot golem can rend only other constructs.
Shockwave (Ex) A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within its nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
