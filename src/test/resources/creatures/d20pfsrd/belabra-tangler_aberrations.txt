SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acidic Blood (Ex) Each time a belabra is hit with a slashing or piercing weapon, all creatures within a 10-ft. radius must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or be sprayed by the creature’s acidic blood. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a –1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a –2 penalty on Perception checks and on Strength– and Dexterity-based skills and checks. All checks relying on vision (such as reading and Perception) have a 50% chance of failing. All opponents are considered to have concealment (20% miss chance) relative to the
blinded character.
Tentacle-Barbs (Ex) A belabra’s tentacles are lined with razor-sharp barbs. Anytime a grappled creature attempts to break free, it takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the barbs.
