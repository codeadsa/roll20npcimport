SPECIAL ABILITIES
Diseased Pustules (Su) A creature that damages a festrog with a slashing or piercing natural weapon, light weapon, or one-handed weapon is sprayed with foul, diseased pus from the creature’s boils. The target must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds from this effect. Anyone who becomes sickened from this effect is also exposed to filth fever (DC 15 Fortitude save negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Feed (Su) When a festrog inflicts bite damage on a living creature, the festrog feeds on the creature’s flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points.
Four-Footed Run (Ex) If a festrog doesn’t hold or carry anything in its hands, it can run on all fours. This increases its speed to 50 feet.
