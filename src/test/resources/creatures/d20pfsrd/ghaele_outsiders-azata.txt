SPECIAL ABILITIES
Gaze (Su) In humanoid form, a ghaele’s gaze attack slays evil creatures of 5 HD or less (range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates, shaken for 2d10 rounds on a successful save). Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be shaken for 2d10 rounds. A creature that saves against a ghaele’s gaze is immune to that particular ghaele’s gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Light Form (Su) A ghaele can shift between its solid body and one made of light as a standard action. In solid form, it cannot fly or use light rays. In light form, it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality—it can make light ray attacks or use spell-like abilities in this form, but can’t make physical attacks or cast spells. This ability otherwise functions similarly to a bralani’s wind form ability.
Light Ray (Ex) A ghaele’s light rays have a range of 300 feet. This attack bypasses all damage reduction.
Spells Ghaeles cast divine spells as 13th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
