SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attach (Ex) When a broodiken succeeds on a bite attack, its teeth latch on. Each round, it automatically does damage to the target as long as it can maintain its grapple. It gains a +4 bonus to checks to maintain its grapple.
Shared Rage (Su) A broodiken cannot speak with its creator telepathically but feels strong emotions and recognizes the objects of those emotions. A creator can telepathically order broodiken to hunt for and attack individuals by sending the broodiken an image of the individual and the appropriate emotion.
