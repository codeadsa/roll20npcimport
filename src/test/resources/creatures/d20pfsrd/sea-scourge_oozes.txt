Acid Jet (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a sea scourge can shoot a stream of acidic juices in a 30-foot line, dealing 2d8 points of acid damage to any creatures in the area (DC 18 Reflex save for half damage). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Sea Scourge Variants
Coldwater Scourge (+0 CR): The coldwater scourge is a menace to merchant ships and war galleons alike. A coldwater scourge is immune to cold damage, and creatures that fail their Reflex saves versus the scourge’s acid jet are also staggered for 1 round.
Steaming Scourge (+1 CR): A steaming scourge possesses additional Hit Dice and the heat universal monster ability, and emits so much energy that any water in a 10-foot-radius spread around it begins to boil, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures that begin their turn submerged in it.
