SPECIAL ABILITIES
Radiance (Su) The andrenjinyi’s spirit scales provide a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier.
Rainbow Arch (Su) The andrenjinyi may instantaneously teleport between sources of fresh water within 1 mile as a full- round action. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. When this power is activated, a rainbow manifests between the origin and destination, lasting for 1 minute.
Transmuting Gullet (Su) Any creature swallowed by the andrenjinyi must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 23; Cha-based) or be affected by baleful polymorph. The andrenjinyi can regurgitate swallowed creatures as a free action.
