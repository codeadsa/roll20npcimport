Gear Wand of Orcus
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 43; onset immediate; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 2d6 Constitution; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
GEAR Unique Item: Wand of Orcus Mighty Orcus wields a huge black skull-tipped rod that functions as a Large +5 unholy greatclub.
It slays any living creature it touches if the target fails a DC 40 Fortitude save. Orcus, can at will, shut this ability off so as to allow his wand to pass into the Material Plane (and usually into the hands of one of his servants).
Further, the wand has the following powers (Caster Level 20th; save DC 25 + spell level):
3/day—animate dead, deeper darkness, desecrate, fear, unhallow
2/day—blasphemy, unholy aura
