TACTICS
Brain rats seem to favor consuming the flesh of other intelligent creatures, and use their detect thoughts ability to pinpoint tasty meals. They then cluster in large groups and wait for their prey to pass by. They lead off with a series of burning hands blasts, focusing on clearing out other threats, while several attempt to disable their primary target with daze. Once their prey is isolated they swarm it in a seething, biting mass.
