TACTICS
The undead ooze has an advantage over any other ooze: intelligence. It uses this new gift to its fullest in combat by attacking from surprise or by stalking its prey and attacking when the opportunity presents itself. The undead ooze attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It usually engulfs its foes or expels its skeleton allies to contend with its enemies.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
Skeletons (Su) As a full-round action, an undead ooze can expel 1d6 skeletons from its mass. Skeletons can act in the round they are expelled, and each skeleton conforms to the basic statistics for its size. Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead ooze and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1d2 hours. An undead ooze’s form holds up to 10 skeletons. These skeletons are included in the determination of the undead ooze’s CR.
