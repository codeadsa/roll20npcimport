TACTICS
A draconid usually waits in its web until prey passes underneath or nearby. It then shoots a web, releases its breath weapon and moves into melee. Once engaged, the draconid bites with one head and breathes fire with the other. One favorite tactic is to slow larger foes with its webs while it snatches up smaller targets in its jaws and crush them, bathing them in fire, and hurling them away if they prove too troublesome.
