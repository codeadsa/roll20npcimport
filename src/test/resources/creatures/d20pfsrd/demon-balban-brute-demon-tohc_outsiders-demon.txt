SPECIAL ABILITIES
Double Damage against Objects (Ex) A balban’s powerful fists are particularly effective against objects. A balban deals double damage against an object or structure.
Pound (Ex) A balban that makes a successful grapple check against a foe smaller than itself can smash the opponent into nearby solid objects (walls, floor, ground, etc.) as a standard action. This deals 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. Further, the victim must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A balban can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.
