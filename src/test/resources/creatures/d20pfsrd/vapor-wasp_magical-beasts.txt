TACTICS
Vapor wasps are not aggressive creatures and generally avoid combat unless threatened or unless the hive is threatened. Creatures wandering within 100 feet of a vapor wasp hive are harassed but almost always left alone. If attacked, or if the hive itself is threatened, the vapor wasps attack relentlessly, using their poisonous sting to fell their opponents.
