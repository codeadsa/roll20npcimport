SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dance of Death (Ex) A necrophidius can entrance opponents by swaying back and forth. Those within 30 feet viewing the dancing snake must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be dazed for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Variants Rattler
A variation of the necrophidius, the rattler is constructed from the skeletal remains of a giant rattlesnake. During the creation process, the tail rattle is left intact and magicked to create a confusion effect on those that hear it rattle. The rattler uses the same statistics as the standard necrophidius except it does not gain the necrophidius’ dance of death special attack. Instead it gains the special attack detailed below.
Rattle (Ex) By shaking its tail rattle, the creature emits a rattling noise to a range of 30 feet. Those within the area that hear this rattle must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be affected as by a confusion spell for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Construction A necrophidius’ body consists of a human skull and the skeletal remains of a constrictor snake treated with rare oils and powders worth at least 1,000 gp.
