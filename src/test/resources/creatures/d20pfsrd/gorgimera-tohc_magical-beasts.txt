SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A gorgimera has two breath weapons, each of which can be used independently of the other (thus it can breathe twice in a given round as a single standard action).
A gorgimera’s dragon head breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera’s breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
To determine a gorgimera’s head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.
1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon
1-2 Black 40 ft. line of acid
3-4 Blue 40 ft. line of lightning
5-6 Green 20 ft. cone of gas (acid)
7-8 Red 20 ft. cone of fire
9-10 White 20 ft. cone of cold
A gorgimera’s gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and allows a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid. The save DC is Constitution-based. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone.
