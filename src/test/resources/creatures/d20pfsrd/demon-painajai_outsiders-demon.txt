SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chain-Spear (Ex) A painajai can hurl its spear at a target within 50 feet with no range penalty. If the attack hits, the painajai can immediately yank the chain to attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver check against the target. The painajai is considered to have the Improved Reposition and Improved Trip feats when performing these maneuvers with its spear only. A reposition combat maneuver performed in this way can only move the target closer to the painajai. The painajai can recover its spear as a swift action.
Dreamwalker (Su) A painajai can travel between the Abyss and the Dimension of Dreams at will, as per dream travel, except that it cannot enter any other planes or take other creatures with it.
