SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Courage (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor radiates an aura of courage identical to that of an 18th-level paladin.
Divine Trigger (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor can activate any paladin spell from a spell trigger item as if he were an 18thlevel paladin.
Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel’s HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.
Truespeech (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.
