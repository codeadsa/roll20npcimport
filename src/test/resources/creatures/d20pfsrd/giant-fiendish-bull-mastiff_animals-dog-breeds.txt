SPECIAL ABILITIES
Smite Good (Su) Once per day, the fiendish creature may smite a good-aligned creature. As a swift action, the creature chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the creature adds its Charisma bonus (if any) to attack rolls and gains a damage bonus equal to its HD against that foe. This effect persists until the target is dead or the creature rests.
Tenacious (Ex) When ordered to track prey (usually humanoid prey), a bull mastiff receives a +4 bonus to any Will saves against enchantments or illusions directed at it, and the DC of any Handle Animal skill check by anyone other than the dogâ€™s master is 5 higher.
