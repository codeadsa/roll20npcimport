SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frostbite Brands (Ex) A saumen kar’s brands infuse the creature with intense cold, so much that it gains resistance to fire 20 and its touch deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. A saumen kar’s metallic weapons also conduct this chill. A saumen kar’s brands can be removed by the spell erase as though they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar’s Hit Dice. If the brands are removed, the saumen kar loses both its fire resistance and its ability to do additional cold damage, until the following dawn when the brands re-etch themselves upon its body.
Snowstorm (Su) In mimicry of its unforgiving environment, a saumen kar can transform into a living snowstorm of lethal power. This ability lasts as long and operates like the whirlwind special attack with the following changes: Creatures within the area of the snowstorm take 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of slashing damage and take a –20 penalty on Perception checks. A saumen kar gains a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect) while in this form.
Stun (Ex) While a saumen kar’s horns are not large enough for a gore attack, they extend under the skin to form a bony plate. A creature struck by a saumen kar’s headbutt must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.
