SPECIAL ABILITIES
False Flesh (Ex) The synthetic flesh and hair of a mannequin robot give it a +8 bonus on Disguise checks to appear human (but not to impersonate a specific human). Closely inspecting a mannequin or touching its cold, synthetic skin automatically reveals its non-human nature.
Variants Other models of mannequin robot resemble the base model shown at left, but have different capabilities. If no CR change is noted, the model has the same CR as a standard mannequin.
Specialized mannequins advance by taking class levels, generally in non-spellcasting classes such as fighter, gunslinger, monk, and rogue.
Athlete (CR +1): Designed to compete in robotic sporting events, an athlete model has +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, Fleet in place of Alertness, and a +5 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks.
Pleasure (CR +1): Designed for entertainment and leisure purposes, a pleasure model has a +4 bonus to Charisma, has Skill Focus (Perform [any]) in place of Alertness, and can scan the minds of creatures within 30 feet (as detect thoughts).
Rescue: Designed for rescue and retrieval operations in conditions too dangerous for unprotected humans, a rescue model’s resistance to electricity and fire improves to 10.
Security (CR +1): Designed for assisting human security forces in dangerous situations, a security model has +2 Dexterity, Improved Initiative in place of Alertness, +1 natural armor, and hardness 5. Security models are proficient with firearms, simple weapons, and light armor.
Target: Designed as an active target for weapons practice, a target model has +2 Dexterity, a 10-foot increase to speed, hardness 5, and Dodge in place of Alertness. Reducing a target model below half its maximum hit points causes it to shut down for 10 minutes.
