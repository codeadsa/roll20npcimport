Variants
Ravager Spawn SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Resistance (Ex) The Ravager possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill or permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment. Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required saving throws.
Energy Resistance (Ex) The Ravager possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic).
Form-Shifting (Ex) The Ravager can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the three listed forms: the Crawler, the Brawler, or the Flier. Doing so takes one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions, though it is not considered helpless.
Magic Disruption (Su) Every time the Ravager comes into contact with a spell or spell-like or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is made each round.
Regeneration (Ex) The Ravager and its brood treat all damage as subdual, except damage from epic-level weapons and artifacts.
Trample (Ex) The Ravager gains its vampiric healing ability on this damage where appropriate. The Ravager does not have this ability in its Flier form. Instead, it gains Snatch as a bonus feat.
Vampiric Healing (Su) Whenever the Ravager hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its trample special attack, where applicable.
