SPECIAL ABILITIES
Psychic Servitude (Su) Echohusks are animated not by typical necromantic energies, but rather by the mental energies of a powerful psychic creature. They cannot be commanded or created by animate dead, command undead, control undead, and similar necromancy spells and effects.
However, any creature that creates an echohusk with its psychic attacks can command that echohusk as if it had animated it using the animate dead spell (up to 4 HD of echohusks per HD of the animating creature, and no one echohusk can possess more than twice the HD of the animating creature).
Echohusks under a creature’s control don’t count against the number of other undead that the creature can control with the animate dead spell, the Command Undead feat, or other similar effects.
Shattered Psyche (Ex) Psychic attacks that are powerful enough to destroy minds leave behind a powerful but unstable force that lashes out at those nearby. When an echohusk takes damage from a melee attack, a ranged attack from within 30 feet, or a psychic spell or effect from any distance, the creature that initiated the attack must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the echohusk’s Hit Dice + the echohusk’s Charisma modifier) or take 1 point of Charisma damage and be dazed for 1 round as the psychic energies in the echohusk shatter once more.
Vulnerable to Psychic Magic (Ex) Echohusks are particularly susceptible to psychic spells and attacks, as the entire force that animates them is composed of psychic energy. They take a –4 penalty on saving throws against psychic spells and effects.
