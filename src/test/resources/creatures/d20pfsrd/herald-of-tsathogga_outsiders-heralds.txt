SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bellow (Su) A herald of Tsathogga has two distinct bellows, each usable once every 1d4 rounds. The first is a trilling croak like that of a frog. All opponents with 30 feet hearing this trilling must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Opponents within 10 feet must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Alternately, a herald can focus its bellow attack against a single opponent within 100 feet. The opponent takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Bloated (Ex) Because of its bloated, heavy body, a herald of Tsathogga that attacks with more than 5 tentacles in one round cannot move that round.
Regeneration (Ex) A herald of Tsathogga takes normal damage from fire and good-aligned weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.
