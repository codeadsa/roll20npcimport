SPECIAL ABILITIES
Arctic Stride (Ex) An adlet can move through any sort of difficult terrain at its normal speed while within arctic or snowy terrain. Magically altered terrain affects an adlet normally.
Frozen Breath (Su) An adlet’s breath is supernaturally cold, and deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage with its bite as a result. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, it can exhale, filling a 10-foot-radius spread around it with frigid air that deals 2d6 points of cold damage and staggers those in the area with numbing cold. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the staggered effect but not the cold damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
