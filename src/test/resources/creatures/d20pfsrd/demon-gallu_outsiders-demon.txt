SPECIAL ABILITIES
Armor Plating (Su) The armor plates covering much of a gallu’s body grant it a +8 armor bonus. They also function as armor spikes during grapples, but cannot be used as offhand weapons. In addition, these armor plates can possess one additional armor special ability chosen from the following options: acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20, fire resistance 20, ghost touch, moderate fortification, or sonic resistance 20. A gallu demon can switch the active armor special quality once per hour as a swift action—as a general rule, the gallu demon keeps the armor plating set to moderate fortification. These armor plates do not encumber the gallu or impose armor check penalties, maximum Dex bonuses, or arcane spell failure chances.
They cannot be removed, sundered, or destroyed while the gallu lives, and they rust away into non-magical fragments of iron upon the gallu’s death.
Aura of Havoc (Su) A gallu’s presence wreaks havoc, infusing battlefields with elements of chaos and entropy that disrupt careful coordination and tactical plotting by manipulating fate and chance. This aura extends to a 30-foot radius around the gallu. The aid another action can never grant bonuses in this area, nor does flanking grant bonuses to hit in the affected area (although flanked foes remain susceptible to sneak attack damage). A creature summoned into this area by any creature other than a demon must succeed at a DC 26 Will save to avoid being confused for 1d4 rounds. Paladins and creatures with the lawful subtype must make a DC 26 Will save each round they begin their turn in this aura to avoid being nauseated for 1 round.
Demons ignore the effects of a gallu’s aura of havoc. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Rain of Blood (Su) As a standard action once per minute, a gallu can command the wounds of all creatures within 30 feet to erupt into a gory deluge of blood; any wounded creature in the area of effect immediately takes 3d6 points of damage from the rain of blood and must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw. Failure indicates that the damage becomes bleed damage and the affected creature becomes staggered from the pain as long as the bleed damage continues. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage are immune to this ability’s effects. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Wounding Blood (Su) The spikes that hold a gallu’s armor plates in place extend as far into the demon’s body as they do outside of it, causing rivulets of blood to constantly run from the creature’s flesh. This continual bleeding does not inconvenience or harm the gallu; instead, it grants the wounding special ability to all manufactured weapons wielded by the gallu. The dripping blood does not affect the gallu’s natural attacks.
