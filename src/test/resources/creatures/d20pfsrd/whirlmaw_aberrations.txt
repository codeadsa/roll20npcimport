SPECIAL ABILITIES Burrowing Bite (Ex) If a whirlmaw successful hits a Small or larger creature with its bite attack, it immediately attempts to start a grapple as a free action with a +4 bonus on the grapple check. If the grapple check is successful, the whirlmaw’s spinning, saw-like mouth immediately begins to burrow into the flesh of the creature, dealing 4d6+12 points of damage per round until the grapple is broken.
Dust Cloud (Ex) By rapidly beating the leathery flaps of skin attached along its body, a whirlmaw can raise a cloud of debris while using its Hover feat just as if it were a Large creature.
Flying Charge (Ex) When a whirlmaw makes a charge attack while flying, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll (rather than the normal +2 bonus), and does not take the normal –2 penalty to Armor Class.
Keen Sight (Ex) A whirlmaw is extremely sharp-sighted. It takes only half the penalty on Perception checks for distance, and can see creatures in open terrain clearly from up to a mile away.
