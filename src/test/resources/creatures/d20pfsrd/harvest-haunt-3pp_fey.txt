SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Complacency (Su) A harvest haunt projects a 100-ft aura that makes all living, non-fey creatures within the area feel complacent. Those affected by the aura must make a DC 17 will save or fall under the effects of a suggestion, that instructs the victim to “Remain inside to eat, drink, and be merry.” Since this is something most people want to do, they often take a -2 penalty on their Will save as per the spell (subject to GM discretion). A creature that saves against this aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma based.
Blighting Touch (Su) The touch of a harvest haunt can convey negative energy into another being. This manifests as a cold-burning sensation that does 1d8 negative energy damage plus the harvest haunt’s Charisma modifier.
