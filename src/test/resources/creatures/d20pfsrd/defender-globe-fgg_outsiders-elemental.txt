SPECIAL ABILITIES
Awareness (Ex) A defender globe cannot be surprised or flanked.
Defensive Aura (Ex) A defender globe adds its Charisma bonus to its AC and CMD as a deflection bonus.
Flight (Su) A defender globe can cease or resume flight as a free action. The ability is supernatural, so it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the defender globe loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists.
