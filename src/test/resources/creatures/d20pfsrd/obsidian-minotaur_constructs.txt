SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action, once every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian minotaur can expel a cloud of gas directly in front of it. The cloud fills a 10-ft. cube and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Burn (Ex) The claws of an obsidian minotaur deal 1d6 points of fire damage each time they hit. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage for 1d4+1 rounds as clothes ignite and armor becomes searing hot. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.
A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur’s structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
