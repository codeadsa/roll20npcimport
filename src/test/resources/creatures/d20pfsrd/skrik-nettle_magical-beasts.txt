SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Su) Levitation poison: Bite or contact—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1 Dexterity damage + levitate (victim rises 10 feet as per the spell per failed save); cure 2 consecutive saves.
Skrik nettle poison can be cured by either remove poison or dispel magic, as if it were caster level 8th. The effect’s CL equals the skrik nettle’s Hit Dice.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spill Poison (Su) Anytime a skrik nettle is damaged by a slashing or piercing melee weapon, it splashes its poison on the opponent who damaged it. That opponent must save or be affected by the skrik nettle’s poison. Weapons with reach allow their wielders to avoid this effect.
