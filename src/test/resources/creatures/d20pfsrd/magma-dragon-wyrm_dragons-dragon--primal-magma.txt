SPECIAL ABILITIES
Superheated (Su) At young age and older, a magma dragon’s bite attack deals additional fire damage equal to its age category.
Magma Breath (Su) Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone of lava instead of fire. The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3 rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust.
