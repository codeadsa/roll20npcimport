SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Despair (Su) A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius. Any creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair of that fye for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Possession (Su) Once per round by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a fye can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fye disappears and enters the target’s body. The save DC is Charisma-based.
