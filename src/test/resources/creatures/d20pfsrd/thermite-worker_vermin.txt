TACTICS
Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off any would-be interlopers. Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young.
