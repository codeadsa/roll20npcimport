SPECIAL ABILITIES
Accursed Breath (Su) As a standard action, a spire drake can spit a compressed ball of jet-black dust that bursts into a spray of clinging motes that sap the spiritual strength of creatures in an area. The attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 5d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 18 half) to all creatures in a 20-foot radius. Affected creatures take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 rounds (or for 1 round on a successful Will save). As long as these motes cling to a creature, the effect of any conjuration (healing) effect used on that creature is halved. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Soul Corruption (Su) If a spire drake successfully performs a coup de grace upon a creature afflicted by its accursed breath, the slain target arises 1d4 rounds later as a wight. This wight is not under the drake’s control, and the wight and any spawn that it creates perish 1d6 days after arising.
Speed Surge (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, a spire drake can draw on its draconic reserves for a boost of strength and speed, allowing it to take an additional move action in that round.
