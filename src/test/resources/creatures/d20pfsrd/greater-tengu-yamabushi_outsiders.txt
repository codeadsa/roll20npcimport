SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cleric Spells (Sp) Yamabushi tengu cast divine spells as 5th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
Gifted Linguist (Ex) As the tengu racial trait.
Mirror Taboo (Su) Yamabushi tengu may not look at themselves in any man-made mirror (Reflex DC 20 avoids), or they take 4 Charisma damage. An atonement spell restores the ability damage.
Wing Baffle (Ex) A yamabushi tengu uses its wings even in combat although not to make slam attacks; it supplements its melee combat with the slaps and whips of its wings to buffet and disorient its opponents. Each round, in addition to its normal attacks, a yamabushi tengu may make a Bluff check against an opponent’s Sense Motive while in combat. If the check is successful, the tengu’s attacks that round gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls.
