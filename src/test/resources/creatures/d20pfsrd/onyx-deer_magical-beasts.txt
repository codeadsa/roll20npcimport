SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bellow (Su) Twice per day, an onyx deer can unleash a rumbling bellow that instills fear in any creature within 100 feet that hears it. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be shaken as long as they remain within the area and for 2d4 rounds afterward. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the bellow of that onyx deer for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Onyx deer are immune to their own bellow and that of other onyx deer.
Onyx Bite (Su) An onyx deer’s bite deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage against a living creature if it fails a DC 18 Fortitude save. A living creature reduced to Constitution 3 or less transforms into onyx, resembling nothing more than a statue. A stone to flesh spell returns a transformed creature to its original form, though if it was reduced to Constitution 0 by the onyx deer’s bite it immediately dies upon returning to its natural form. The save DC is Constitution-based.
