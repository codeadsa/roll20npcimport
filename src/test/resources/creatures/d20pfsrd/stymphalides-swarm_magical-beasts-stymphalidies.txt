SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dazzle (Ex) As a stymphalides swarm beats its wings, the birds’ steel feathers reflect light in blinding patterns of flashes and flares. While in an area of normal or brighter light, anyone who occupies the same square as a stymphalides swarm at the beginning of its turn must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Those who fail are blinded for 1d4 rounds, while those who make their saves are dazzled until they spend 1 full round outside the swarm’s space. This is a sight-based effect.
