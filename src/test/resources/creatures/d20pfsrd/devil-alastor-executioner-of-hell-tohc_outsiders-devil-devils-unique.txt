TACTICS
Alastor rarely engages in combat; not because he cannot, but because most such encounters are trivial to him and he becomes bored with it very easily. If pressed into battle, he uses his power word kill ability immediately against his closest opponent. Next, he unleashes a meteor storm, followed by a fireball, before finishing his spell-like abilities with a mass hold monster against as many foes as possible. Next he wades into battle with Grimfang and his array of natural attacks. When he finally becomes bored with the battle, he seeks to quickly end it by calling in other devils to finish off any remaining opponents. Should Alastor be in danger at any time, he uses his greater teleport to escape, remembering his foes for a later time, which he will invariably hunt down with a retinue of pit fiends and kill.
