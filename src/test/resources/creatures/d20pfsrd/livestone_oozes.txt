SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) A livestone that has engulfed an opponent can instantly solidify its form, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round to the trapped victim (DC 17 Fort half). The save DC is Strength-based.
An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting stone to flesh on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim.
Solidify (Ex) A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The save DC is Strength-based.
