Static Discharge (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as part of a move action that’s taken to fly at least 10 feet, a warmonger wasp’s wings can discharge a bolt of electricity to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
The save DC is Constitution-based.
