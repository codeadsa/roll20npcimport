SPECIAL ABILITIES
Lunge (Ex) Garmunchi receive the Lunge feat as a bonus racial feat.
Nimbleness (Ex) The long, thin limbs of the garmunchi hide significant strength and grace. Garmunchi ignore terrain penalties when taking a single move, and may run up to 6 times their normal speed with a run action. Garmunchi also gain a +2 racial bonus to their CMD when being tripped.
Roar (Su) As a standard action, a garmunchi can let out a great and terrifying roar that can break the will of the hardiest adversaries. The roar is a 20 ft. cone of attack that deals 4d4 sonic damage (Reflex save DC 17 for half damage). All those that take damage from the roar attack must succeed a DC 17 Will save or be shaken. A garmunchi can do this 3 times per day. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
