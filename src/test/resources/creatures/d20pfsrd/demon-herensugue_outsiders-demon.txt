SPECIAL ABILITIES
Horrifying Trill (Su) The herensugue can emit a noise that reminds the listener of its darkest fears and greatest phobias. Any creature within 60 feet that fails on DC 20 Will save when the herensugue emits a horrifying trill is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same herensugue’s horrifying trill for 24 hours.
Lure (Su) Although the herensugue cannot speak, their skeletal jaws can emit noises that mimic music, laughter and voices. Any creature within 60 feet of a herensugue while it makes such noises must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or walk towards the source of the sounds. A victim under the effects of the lure moves toward the herensugue using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the herensugue simply stands there. This effect continues for as long as the herensugue emits sounds and for 1 round thereafter. The effect ends immediately if the herensugue attacks an affected creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same herensugue’s lure for 24 hours.
Many Throats (Ex) As a full-round action, the herensugue can use either its horrifying trill or lure ability and make two melee attacks in the same round.
