TACTICS
This monster’s tactics are simple. It waits for beings to attempt to draw water from the apparently bottomless depth before lashing out with tentacles, attempting to draw prey into its fanged mouth, biting and devouring foes whole. Cutting oneself out from the well lurker is nearly impossible as they brace their girth against solid stone, meaning one would have to climb out through the mouth of the beast in order to escape certain death and painful digestion.
