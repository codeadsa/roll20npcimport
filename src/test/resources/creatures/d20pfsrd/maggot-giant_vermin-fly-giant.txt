Regurgitate (Ex)
Once per day, a giant maggot can empty its putrid stomach upon one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 minute (or until the target spends a full-round action with at least a gallon of water to wash off the filth). The save DC is Constitution-based.
