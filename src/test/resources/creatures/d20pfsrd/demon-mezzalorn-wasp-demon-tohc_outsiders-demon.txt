TACTICS
Mezzalorn tactics are simple and straightforward: fly into battle, sting a foe repeatedly until it dies. Often a mezzalorn grabs a foe, flies upward away from the opponent’s allies, and stings its grappled victim until it dies, dropping the carcass without thought or care before wading back into the battle. Mezzalorn’s hate stirge demons and fly demons and attack them on sight.
