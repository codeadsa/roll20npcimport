TACTICS
During Combat The chupacabra enjoys tormenting and scaring its prey, but once battle begins, it abandons subtlety. It charges the smallest target, attempting to pounce and then pin its foe so it can chupar (although if it’s surrounded by foes, it certainly won’t use this tactic). The creature is quite agile, and against larger numbers of foes it uses Flyby Attack and Acrobatics to swoop in, attack, and deny attacks of opportunity. lf it can, it tries to lure victims away from allies so it can pounce and feed.
Morale The chupacabra fights until it is reduced to 25 hit points or fewer before retreating to its nest. Cornered there, the beast fights to the death.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chupar (Ex) A chupacabra can suck blood from a living victim it has grappled by successfully pinning the foe. If it does so, it drains blood, causing 1 point of Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained. Upon draining blood, a chupacabra becomes invigorated, as if under the effects of a haste spell. This effect lasts for 10 rounds after the chupacabra ceases drinking blood.
