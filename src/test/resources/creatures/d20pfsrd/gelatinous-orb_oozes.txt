SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf Head (Ex) Gelatinous orbs have the uncanny ability to jump up and land on a Medium-sized or smaller creature’s head, completely engulfing it as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. Opponents can either make an attack of opportunity against the ooze, or a saving throw versus the attack, but not both. If the target forgoes the opportunity attack, it may instead make a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid having its head engulfed. If the save fails, or the target instead opted to make an opportunity attack, the target takes 1d4 acid damage, is blinded, deafened, nauseated, and is in danger of suffocating every round that its head is engulfed. Any attack against a gelatinous orb that has engulfed an opponent’s head has a 50% chance of targeting the engulfed opponent instead.
Transparent (Ex) A gelatinous orb is clear and colorless. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a motionless orb.
