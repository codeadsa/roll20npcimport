SPECIAL ABILITIES
Camouflage (Ex) Since a vampire rose looks like a normal white rose bush when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.
