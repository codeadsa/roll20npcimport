SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) With its animate dead spell-like ability a gnarlwood can animate any corpse within 60 feet. Because of their arboreal habitat, most gnarlwoods are accompanied by animal zombies and skeletons.
Unhallowed Aura (Su) A gnarlwood emanates an unhallow spell in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Thus, a gnarlwood is constantly protected as by a magic circle from good, and the DC to resist positive channeled energy within 20 feet of it is reduced by 4 (at the same time the DC to resist negative channeled energy within 20 feet of a gnarlwood gain a +4 bonus). This aura can be dispelled or negated, but the gnarlwood can restart it again as a free action on its next turn.
