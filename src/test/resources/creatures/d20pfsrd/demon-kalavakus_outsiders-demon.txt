SPECIAL ABILITIES
Enslave Soul (Su) A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within 60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the target. The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save, but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save is a failure, the target’s soul is enslaved—this creature takes a –6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul immediately infuses the demon’s body, affecting it with a heal spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time—if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Horns (Ex) The kalavakus’s numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts as a result.
