SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) If a hell moth grapples an opponent it can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its wings and body and automatically deal bite damage in each round it maintains the grapple. Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Immolation (Su) A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).
Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.
