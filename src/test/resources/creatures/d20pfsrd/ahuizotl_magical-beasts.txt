SPECIAL ABILITIES
Tenacious Grapple (Ex) An ahuizotl does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe.
Voice Mimicry (Ex) An ahuizotl can perfectly mimic the sound of humanoid sobbing and can even attempt to mimic voices it has heard. When mimicking a voice, an ahuizotl must make a Bluff check opposed by its listenerâ€™s Sense Motive check. If the listener has never heard the voice the ahuizotl is attempting to mimic, the listener takes a -8 penalty on the Sense Motive check.
