SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Spikes (Su) Natural and worked stone surfaces within 5 feet of a spikestone guardian temporarily reshape themselves into spiky surfaces. This aura moves with the guardian, and the spike stones persist only as long as the guardian is within 5 feet. If the guardian moves adjacent to a creature, that creature is not affected by the spike stones unless it moves. Any creature moving into, out of, or through a square within 5 feet of the guardian moves at half speed and takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each square crossed. In addition, that creature must make a DC 16 Reflex save or have its movement reduced by half until it receives magical healing or a DC 16 Heal check administered over the course of 10 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Geniebound (Su) Unlike most stone guardians, these spikestone guardians are not linked to a specific ring that allows its wearer to command them. Instead, both of these constructs are bound to Obherak—they obey his commands without question, and if the shaitan is slain, a spikestone guardian immediately goes berserk, attacking the closest creature (even another spikestone guardian) for 1d6 rounds before it crumbles apart into rubble.
See Invisibility (Su) A spikestone guardian can employ see invisibility, as per the spell.
Spike Volley (Su) A spikestone guardian’s spike volley targets one foe. It has a range increment of 60 feet.
