SPECIAL ABILITIES Curse (Su) Instead of poison, the spines of black spot urchins bear what is for some a minor annoyance, but for sailors nearly a death sentence. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spines—injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 round; frequency constant; effect target takes a –10 penalty on Swim checks and cannot hold its breath. If forced underwater, the target must save each round or drown.
Leaping Charge (Ex) A black spot urchin ignores rough terrain and gaps less than 10 feet wide when charging. Additionally, its charges do no provoke attacks of opportunity.
Spines (Ex) A black spot’s spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any creature that attacks a black spot urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack is automatically attacked by the black spot’s spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can curse the target as well.
Stability (Ex) All giant urchins and similar creatures—like black spots—receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.
