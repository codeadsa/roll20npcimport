SPECIAL ABILITIES
Confusion (Su) The coloration on the gloomwing’s back and wings provide it with protection against some predators. Any creature viewing the gloomwing from above must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Implant Egg (Ex) As a standard action, a female gloomwing can lay eggs inside a slain creature of Small or larger size. The young emerge about 2 weeks later as a tenebrous worms (see that entry), literally devouring the host from inside. While implanted, a body cannot be raised or resurrected except by the casting of a true resurrection, wish, or miracle, If remove disease or heal is cast on the body, the eggs are destroyed and the body can be raised normally.
Pheromone Call (Ex) Each round a gloomwing emits its weakness pheromone there is a 20% chance that 1d4 additional gloomwings arrive in the area and join the battle. This is not a summoning spell or spell-like ability; the gloomwings can detect the pheromone and are automatically drawn to it.
Weakness Pheromone (Ex) After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action that deals 1d2 points of Strength damage to any living, non-vermin creature (except gloomwings) in the area. An affected creature can make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area to negate the effects. On a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same gloomwing’s weakness pheromone for 24 hours. The pheromone ceases when the gloomwing dies. Strength damage dealt by a gloomwing’s pheromone heals faster than normal (1 point per hour rather that 1 point per night of rest). The save DC is Constitution-based.
