SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) When a crimson death strikes a target with one of its tentacles, it can immediately make an engulf attack, including moving into the opponent’s square. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the crimson death, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex (DC 18) save to avoid being engulfed—on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target’s choice) as the crimson death moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the crimson death’s body until they are no longer pinned, and suffer 1d6 points of damage and 1d6 points of Constitution damage every round. A victim reduced to 0 Constitution dies. The save DC is Strength-based.
Susceptibility (Ex) After draining its victim’s Constitution, the crimson death, sated from its feeding, moves at half its normal speed, loses its racial bonus to Stealth checks (because it flushes crimson, hence the name), and suffers a –4 circumstance penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 hour.
