SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shatter Spray (Ex) The first time a ship in a bottle fires its ballista, rams a creature, or is dealt weapon damage, the bottle containing it shatters, spraying glass in a circle around it. All creatures in a 5-foot radius take 1d6 points of piercing damage. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves this additional damage.
Ship in a Bottle Construction
A ship in a bottle can be created through a binding ritual undertaken by a powerful spellcaster. The ritual requires a masterwork model ship in a bottle that must be built from materials worth 100 gp, and DC 30 Craft (woodworking) skill checks made over 2 consecutive weeks. Alternatively, a masterwork model ship in a bottle can instead be purchased for the ritual, but it must be worth at least 600 gp.
