SPECIAL ABILITIES Envelop (Ex) The moss monster can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its vines as a standard action. The moss monster attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the moss monster while it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Poison Cloud (Ex) The moss monster can exude a cloud of poisonous gas in a 20-foot radius up to 3 times per day. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 hours afterward. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
