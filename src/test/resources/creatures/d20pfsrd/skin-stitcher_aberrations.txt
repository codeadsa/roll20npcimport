SPECIAL ABILITIES
Augmented Critical (Ex) If the skin stitcher scores a critical hit with a chain rake, it deals triple normal damage to an opponent.
Rage (Ex) A skin stitcher that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, attacking its foe until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC while raging. The skin stitcher cannot end its rage voluntarily. Note that the skin stitcher does not drop its chains while raging.
Skin Scent (Ex) The skin stitcher can detect any living creature that possesses natural skin to a distance of one-half mile. This includes all creature types, in most cases, except plants, elementals, oozes, constructs, vermin, and many undead (undead with flesh, such as zombies, can be detected by a skin stitcher, but skeletons cannot).
