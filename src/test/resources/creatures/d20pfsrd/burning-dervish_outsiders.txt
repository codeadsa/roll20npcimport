SPECIAL ABILITIES
Elemental Endurance (Ex) Burning dervishes can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Planes of Water for up to 12 hours. Failure to return to the Elemental Planes of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies after that time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a burning dervish until it dies or returns to the Elemental Planes of Fire.
Flame Form (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, a burning dervish can change its form to that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam attacks. The transformation lasts indefinitely; changing back requires another standard action.
