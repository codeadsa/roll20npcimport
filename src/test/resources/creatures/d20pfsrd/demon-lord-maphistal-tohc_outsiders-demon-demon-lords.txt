TACTICS
Maphistal is rarely, if ever, encountered alone, and usually has a retinue of undead with him. When he enters combat, he usually opens with his spell-like abilities, immediately using his circle of death ability to affect as many targets as possible. In melee, he batters an opponent with his mace. An opponent whose skull is destroyed (and therefore slain) or an opponent brought to Dexterity 0 (and not rescued by his comrades) is carried back to the Keep of Bones where it is transformed into an undead creature or becomes part of the Keep itself.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bone Knit (Su) Each time a living creature is hit by a weapon wielded by Maphistal, it must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its bones fuse together. Creatures without bones or skeletal structures (such as oozes and plants) are immune to this effect.
Disease (Ex) Demon Fever: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 31; onset 1day, frequency 1 day, effect 1d6 Con damage and target must make a second Fort save or 1 point of the damage is Con drain instead, cure 2 consecutive saves.
GEAR Unique Item: Vox Maphistal’s unique weapon is a +3 unholy crushing heavy mace.
The crushing special quality crushes the skulls of those it strikes. Upon a successful critical hit, the weapon crushes the opponent’s skull (if it has one) instantly killing the target. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no skulls, others, such as golems and incorporeal undead, are not affected by the crushing special quality. Most other creatures, however, die when their skull is crushed.
