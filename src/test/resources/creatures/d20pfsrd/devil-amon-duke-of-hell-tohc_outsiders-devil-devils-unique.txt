SPECIAL ABILITIES
Control Wolves (Su) Amon can control up to 40 HD of wolves, worgs, winter wolves, or dire wolves to a range of 1 mile. This is otherwise similar to a control undead spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer and does not count against his 40 HD summoning limit (unless Amon summoned the creatures).
Fear Gaze (Su) A creature that successfully saves against Amon’s fear gaze cannot be affected again for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
GEAR Unique Item: Craver
Amon’s unique oversized weapon Craver is a Huge +4 axiomatic thundering heavy mace.
In Duke Amon’s hands Craver deals double his Strength bonus to damage in addition to its +4 enhancement bonus when he uses it two-handed (+30 total). He is able to use Craver without penalty.
