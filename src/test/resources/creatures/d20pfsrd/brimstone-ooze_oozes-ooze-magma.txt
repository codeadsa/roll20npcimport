SPECIAL ABILITIES
Lava Body (Ex) The brimstone ooze is formed of molten rock. Whenever a creature strikes a brimstone ooze with a weapon, that weapon takes 4d6 points of fire damage unless the attacker makes a DC 19 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Smite Good (Su) Once per day, the brimstone ooze may smite a good-aligned creature. As a swift action, the brimstone ooze chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the brimstone ooze adds its Charisma bonus (if any) to attack rolls and gains a damage bonus equal to its HD against that foe. This effect persists until the target is dead or the brimstone ooze rests.
Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental, that strikes a brimstone ooze forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. A brimstone ooze that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or become petrified, reverting once the water is gone.
