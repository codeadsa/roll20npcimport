SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A khala can fire a jet of frigid liquid from one of its three mouths, dealing 16d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 27 half). Even if they succeed at the Reflex save, creatures caught in the line must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be encased in ice.
A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or DC 26 Escape Artist check as a full-round action to break free.
Disease (Ex) Chillbane Fever: Bite—injury; save Fortitude DC 27; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, sickened, and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grabs a foe with its tail, and it can maintain a grapple with its tail as a swift action.
