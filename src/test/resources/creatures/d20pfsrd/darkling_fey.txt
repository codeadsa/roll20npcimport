SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Healing (Su) If a darkling spends a move action licking the blood of a recent victim off its stone battleaxe or its claws, it gains fast healing 3 for 2 rounds. A darkling can heal up to a maximum of 20 hp/day (double its current HD) in this manner. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Feystone Battleaxe A darkling wields crude tools made from stone and worked in a way that only the fey know how. A mundane large feystone battleaxe cost 10 gp, weights 18 lbs, grants a -2 penalty on attacks, grants a +2 bonus when attempting to sunder, deals 2d8-1+Str modifier damage, deals double damage on a critical hit, has a hardness of 7, and has 7 hp.
Flicker (Sp) A darkling can turn invisible for 1 round as a swift action. The spell-like ability ends if the darkling attacks any creature (see invisibility). This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.
Planar Knowledge (Ex) Knowledge (planes) is a class skill for a darkling. Knowledge (local) is not a class skill.
Snow Spray (Sp) A 30 ft cone of snow sprays out from a darkling’s fingertips. All creatures within the area of effect take 5d4 points of cold damage and are entangled for 1 round. Creatures that succeeds a Reflex save (DC 13) take half damage and are not entangled. The DC for this ability is Charisma-based. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.
