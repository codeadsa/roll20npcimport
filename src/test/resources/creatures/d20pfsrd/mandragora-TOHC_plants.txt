TACTICS
A mandragora attacks its opponent by slashing and striking with its upper root-tentacles. It attempts to grab its prey and strangle it. If it succeeds, the mandragora hangs on until either it or its opponent is dead. Slain creatures are covered in a thick layer of mucus and slime and devoured at the mandragoraâ€™s leisure.
