SPECIAL ABILITIES
Touch of Ages (Su) When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target’s age or mentally reduce the target’s age. If it increases the target’s physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target’s mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami’s numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim’s true age—it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.
