TACTICS
During Combat Trolls are single-minded berserkers in combat. They attack the nearest foe without hesitation and don’t stop until that foe is down.
Morale Because of their regenerative abilities, trolls are fearless. Even flames or the presence of acid don’t slow them down—they always fight to the death.
