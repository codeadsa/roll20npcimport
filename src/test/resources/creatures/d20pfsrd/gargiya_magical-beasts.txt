SPECIAL ABILITIES
Boiling Seas (Ex) Once per minute, a gargiya can concentrate the heat within its body, causing seawater in a 20-foot radius to boil for 1d6 rounds. All creatures caught in this boiling seawater take 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures spending 2 or more consecutive rounds subjected to this damage must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Dying Gasp (Su) When a gargiya is killed, it disgorges from its gullet the molten boulder that heats its body. Its fiery death throes deal 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Scalding Scales (Ex) A gargiya generates such intense heat that anything touching it takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a gargiya with natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage.
Any metal weapon striking a gargiya must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or melt, gaining the broken condition. A metal weapon that fails a second save is destroyed. Wooden weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
