SPECIAL ABILITIES
Burrow (Ex) Dogmoles cannot burrow into solid rock, but they can move through softer material like soil or loose rubble, leaving a usable tunnel 5 ft. in diameter.
Wormkiller Rage (Ex) Wild dogmole packs are famed for their battles against monsters in the dark caverns of the world. If it draws blood against a vermin, purple worm, or other underground invertebrate, the dogmole gains a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitution but suffers a -2 penalty to AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). It cannot end the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage still lives.
