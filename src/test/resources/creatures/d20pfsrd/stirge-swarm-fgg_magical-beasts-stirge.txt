SPECIAL ABILITIES
Diseased (Ex) Stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge‘s blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease. Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.
