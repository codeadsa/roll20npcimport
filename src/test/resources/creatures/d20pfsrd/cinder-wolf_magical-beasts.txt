TACTICS
When encountered alone, a cinder wolf attempts to run down its prey, attacking only once its victim is too tired to put up a fight. In packs, they circle prey, trapping their victims between multiple pack members. Once the prey slows down, the cinder wolves surround their target and close in, setting themselves up to receive flanking bonuses. When fighting an opponent of its size or larger, a cinder wolf tries to trip its foe and attack it on the ground, giving itself and any pack members a better chance to bite.
An individual cinder wolf breaks off the attack if reduced to fewer than 5 hit points. A group of cinder wolves retreats if more than 75% of their original number are slain or have already fled.
