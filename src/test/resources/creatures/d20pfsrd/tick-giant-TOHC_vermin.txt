SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Drain (Ex) A giant tick drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it detaches crawls off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the giant tick’s appetite has been sated, the giant tick detaches and seeks a new target.
Disease (Ex) Fifty percent of all giant ticks carry and deliver red ache with a bite attack. Roll individually for each giant tick in the cluster or nest.
Red ache: Bite–injury; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
