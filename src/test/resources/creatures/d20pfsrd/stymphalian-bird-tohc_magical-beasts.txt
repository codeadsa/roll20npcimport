TACTICS
Stymphalian birds are particularly fond of the flesh of humans and elves, and always attack them on sight.
A stymphalian bird attacks from the air by releasing a volley of bronze feathers at its opponents. It then swoops down and attacks with its beak and wings, flying out of range before its opponents can react. On the ground, a stymphalian bird slashes with its wings and stabs with its beak.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Feathers (Ex) A stymphalian bird can loose a volley of four feathers as a standard action when flying (make an attack roll for each feather). This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twelve feathers (3 volleys) in a single day. The stymphalian bird may use this ability in conjunction with its Flyby Attack feat.
