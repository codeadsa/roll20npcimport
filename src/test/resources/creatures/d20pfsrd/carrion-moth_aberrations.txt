SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drone (Ex) The flapping wings of a carrion moth emit a mind-numbing drone that affects all creatures within 80 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carrion moth’s drone attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Stench (Ex) When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a foul-smelling gas. All living creatures (except other carrion moths) within 5 feet of the carcass must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the nauseated creature. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
