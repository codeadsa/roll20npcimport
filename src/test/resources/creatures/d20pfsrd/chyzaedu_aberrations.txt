SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alien Vestment (Su) A chyzaedu wears a sheet of undulating metallic material blessed by its inscrutable gods. The chyzaedu treats this garment as a +1 moderate fortification breastplate that provides immunity to mind-affecting effects. The vestment also serves as a divine focus for any spell the chyzaedu casts. This vestment doesn’t function for any creature other than the chyzaedu for which it was originally crafted. If a chyzaedu’s vestment is stolen or destroyed, the chyzaedu can create a replacement with a month of work.
Ecstatic Hunger Aura (Su) A chyzaedu’s zealous drive to consume infects the minds of those around it. Any living creature within 30 feet of a chyzaedu must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or immediately consume any food and beverages (including potions and the like) on its person or within its reach. This effect continues for as long as it takes the creature to consume all the food and beverages within its reach. The creature defends itself normally but takes no other actions while eating and drinking. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spell Casting Chyzaedu cast divine spells as 10th-level clerics, but they do not gain access to domains or to any other cleric abilities.
