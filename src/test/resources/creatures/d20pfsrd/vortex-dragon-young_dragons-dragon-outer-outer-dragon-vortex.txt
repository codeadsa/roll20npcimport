SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agile (Ex) Vortex dragons have good maneuverability when flying regardless of their age or size.
Alien Presence (Su) A vortex dragon’s alien presence bends space. A creature that fails its saving throw treats all other creatures as if they were under the effects of blur (or displacement if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.
Galactic Emissary (Su) A young or older vortex dragon halves the time of any starflight journey. In addition, it’s immune to any effect that bars extradimensional travel.
