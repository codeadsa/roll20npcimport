SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a darnoc becomes a darnoc in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Curse of the Grave (Su) Any damage dealt by a darnoc’s slam attack does not heal naturally and resists all magical healing (potions, cure spells, and so on). Before the damage can be healed, the curse must first be broken with a break enchantment or remove curse spell (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell).
Ghost Form (Su) As a standard action, a darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes each day. While incorporeal, the darnoc has AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 deflection) and can use its slam attack as an incorporeal touch against corporeal targets dealing 1d6+1 points of negative energy damage as well as curse of the grave.
Symbol of Discord (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible.
If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 2 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
