SPECIAL ABILITIES
Persuasion (Su) Biloko can gradually insinuate their desires into the minds of those in the power of their charm person spell-like ability. For every 10 minutes a humanoid is under the influence of a biloko’s charm person, the victim takes a –1 penalty on her opposed Charisma check (to a maximum of –5) when the biloko is trying to convince her to do something she would not normally do. This penalty applies to the charm of only a single biloko and is reduced back to 0 as soon as the victim breaks free or the spell ends.
