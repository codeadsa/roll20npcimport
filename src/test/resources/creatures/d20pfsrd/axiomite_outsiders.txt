SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crystalline Dust Form (Su) An axiomite can shift between its solid body and one made of golden, crystalline dust as a free action once per round. In dust form, the axiomite looks like a shifting mass of glowing mathematical symbols and equations. In this form it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality; it can use spelllike abilities but cannot make physical attacks. In its solid form, an axiomite cannot fly. Both shapes are the axiomite’s true form, and it does not revert to a different form if killed. A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.
Summon Inevitable (Sp) Once per day, four axiomites may join hands to summon a single zelekhut inevitable as a full-round action.
