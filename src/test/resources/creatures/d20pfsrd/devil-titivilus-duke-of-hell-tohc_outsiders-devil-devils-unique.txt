TACTICS
Titivilus prefers to avoid combat, if possible. If pressed, he attacks with his spell-like abilities, seeking to sew confusion and disorder among his adversaries. In close combat, he uses his longsword, but usually summons other devils before such combat occurs. If facing imminent defeat, Titivilus summons other devils to cover his escape.
