The xenopterid can slime up to a 10-foot-square area per day at a rate of 1 square foot per minute. For 1 week thereafter, any creature coming in direct contact with the slime must succeed at a DC 19 Strength check or be entangled and glued to it as if it had failed its save against a tanglefoot bag. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
