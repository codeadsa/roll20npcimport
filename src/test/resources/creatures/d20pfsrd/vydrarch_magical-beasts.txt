SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison Spines (Ex) A vydrarch is covered in jagged spines that secrete a fatal poison. A creature struck by a vydrarch’s tail slap attack or that strikes a vydrarch with a melee weapon without reach, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned. Any creature that grapples a vydrarch takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned each round.
Vydrarch poison: Spine—injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con, 1d2 Wis; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Veil of Fog (Su) As a standard action, a vydrarch can produce a bank of fog in a 100-foot spread centered on itself. This effect is otherwise identical that created by a fog cloud spell.
