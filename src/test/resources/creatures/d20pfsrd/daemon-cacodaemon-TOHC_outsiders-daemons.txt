SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alter Self (Su) A cacodaemon can assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid as a standard action. This supernatural ability works like alter self (CL 12th), but the cacodaemon can remain in the chosen form indefinitely. It can assume a new form as a standard action or return to its own as a free action.
