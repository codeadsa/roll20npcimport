SPECIAL ABILITIES
Desert Thirst (Su) A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 12). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 20) or be destroyed.
Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener’s Sense Motive check.
