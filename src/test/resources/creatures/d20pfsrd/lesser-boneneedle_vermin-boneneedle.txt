SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aversion to Daylight (Ex) Boneneedles shun all light. If exposed to natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), they take a –4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
Crowd (Ex) These monsters crawl over each other in an attempt to swarm an opponent. Up to three boneneedles can occupy a single 5-foot space.
Poison (Ex) The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the poison’s secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2 points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself.
Creatures without bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone), oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning.
