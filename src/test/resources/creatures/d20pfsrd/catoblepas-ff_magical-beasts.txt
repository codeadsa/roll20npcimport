SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disintegrating Gaze (Su) The catoblepas can focus disintegrating energy from its eyes against one creature within 30 feet. Unless the creature succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save, part of its body is disintegrated. Roll todetermine the effect:
Arm: target takes 4d6+4 damage and a -4 penalty to Strength Leg: target takes 4d6+4 damage, a -2 penalty to Dexterity and can only move by crawling Body: target takes 4d6+4 damage and is fatigued for 2d4 rounds Body: target takes 4d6+4 damage and is staggered for 2d4 rounds The target only takes half damage with a successful save. Damage reduction does not reduce the damage. A creature can only suffer the first two results if it possesses a sufficient number of limbs. Otherwise roll between results 3 and 4. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Foul Stench (Ex) The catoblepas emits a disgusting odor. Creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that save are immune to that catoblepasâ€™s foul stench for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
