SPECIAL ABILITIES
Abduct (Ex) When a boggart hits a single target with both of its claw attacks as part of a full-attack action, it can attempt a drag combat maneuver check as a free action. The boggart can move more than 5 feet as part of this combat maneuver even if it doesn’t have any movement remaining for the round.
