SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Size (Sp) Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 14 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma–based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd–level spell. Heat (Ex) A cheitan’s body deals 1d3 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee with a natural attack or in each round it maintains a hold while grappling.
Elemental Endurance (Ex) Jann can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours at a time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.
