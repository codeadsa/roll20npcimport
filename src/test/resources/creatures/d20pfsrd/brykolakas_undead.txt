SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or monstrous humanoid killed by a brykolakas rises as a lacedon in 1d4 days under the control of the brykolakas that created it.
Death Throes (Su) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, a brykolakas is destroyed and its body changes into a pool of deadly poison that quickly (1 round) fills a 10-foot cube (if its in the water when destroyed). The poison disperses in the next round. Creatures in the area are exposed to the poison.
If a brykolakas is slain on land, its body collapses into a puddle of briny liquid that quickly covers a 10-foot square area. The puddle lasts for 1d2 rounds before dispersing. Creatures touching the puddle are exposed to the poison.
Brykolakas poison—Contact; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Disease (Su) A brykolakas’s claw attacks deliver a virulent disease that breaks down the victim’s internal organs (causing internal bleeding and a darkening of the skin). This supernatural disease is called brykolakas fever. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Brykolakas fever—Claw; disease, save Fortitude DC 16 negates, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/day, effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Dex damage, cure 1 save.
Change Shape (Su) A brykolakas can remain in an alternate form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise.
Water Dependency (Ex) A brykolakas can survive out of the water for 6 hours. After that, its body begins drying out and within 1 hour, the brykolakas crumbles into dust unless it can reach saltwater before the hour passes.
