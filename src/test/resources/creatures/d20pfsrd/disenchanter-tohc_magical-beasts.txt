TACTICS
A disenchanter targets magical items carried or worn by an opponent. A disenchanter is able to discern the most powerful magical items in a group and always attack those items first, unless those items are too difficult to reach (such as hidden in a backpack), in which case the disenchanter will choose to attack a more readily available item (such as a magical shield). It fastens its snout onto an item and drains the item’s magical properties. Magical weapons striking a disenchanter cannot be drained of their magical properties.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disenchantment (Ex) A disenchanter that makes a successful touch attack with its snout drains one magic item carried or worn by the target (determined randomly by the GM). If the disenchanter aims at a particular item, it must make an attack roll against that item’s AC. Items worn or carried have an AC equal to 10 + its size modifier + the opponent’s Dexterity modifier (if any). A disenchanter does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using this ability.
An item struck must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or permanently lose all magical properties it possesses. An unattended magic item has a save bonus equal to 2 + one half its caster level. An attended magic item either makes its save as its owner or uses its own saving throw whichever is better. The save DC is Constitution-based. Disenchanters cannot affect artifacts.
