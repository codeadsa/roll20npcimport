SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A young or older sovereign dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as polymorph.
Dogmatic Discordance (Su) Good or evil creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon’s spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura.
Golden Armor (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an old or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon’s age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.
Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.
