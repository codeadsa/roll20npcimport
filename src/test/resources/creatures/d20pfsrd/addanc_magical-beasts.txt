SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a addanc can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The addanc inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the addanc maintains its grapple.
Hold Breath (Ex) An addanc may hold its breath for (four times its Con score) rounds before beginning to drown.
Swimming Grapple (Ex) An addanc can swim at full swim speed while grappling a creature.
