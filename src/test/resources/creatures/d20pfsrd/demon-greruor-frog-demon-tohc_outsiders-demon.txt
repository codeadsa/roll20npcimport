TACTICS
During Combat Greruors enjoy combat and seek it wherever they can find it. Normally they rely on their natural attacks, spittle, and weapons to fell opponents. If outmatched, they use confusion to disorient opponents, followed closely by shatter. Grabbed opponents are often held in the mouth of one greruor while another stabs the victim with its ranseur.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid and Fire Spittle (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a greruor can spit a 30-ft. long line of acid that deals 4d4 points of acid damage. On the greruor’s next turn, the acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flames taking 1d6 points of fire damage per round until extinguished. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the acid damage and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save DC is Constitution-based.
