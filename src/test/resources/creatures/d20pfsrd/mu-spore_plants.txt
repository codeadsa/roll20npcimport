SPECIAL ABILITIES
Grasping Tendrils (Ex) Sticky, arm-length tendrils cover a mu spore. A mu spore can use these tendrils to attempt a grab as an immediate action when an adjacent creature hits with a melee attack. As it is only using the tendrils (instead of conducting the grapple normally), it takes a –20 penalty to its CMB to make and maintain the grapple (+31 CMB with tendrils). The mu spore does not gain the grappled condition while grappling a creature with its tendrils.
Spore Cough (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a mu spore can release a cloud of burrowing spores in a 100-foot cone. The burrowing spores deal 20d8 points of damage to all creatures and wooden structures in the area, or half damage to any creatures that make a DC 34 Reflex save. Plants and plant creatures are immune to this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
