SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animate Trees (Su) An algoid can animate trees within 90 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is otherwise similar to liveoak.

Mind Blast (Sp) Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Stun (Ex) If an algoid scores a critical hit with a slam attack, the opponent struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A control water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to an algoid (no save).
