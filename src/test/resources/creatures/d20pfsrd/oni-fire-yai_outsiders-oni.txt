SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fiery Missile (Su) As a swift action, a fire yai can launch a bolt of fire from its third eye. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.
Smoke Form (Sp) As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.
