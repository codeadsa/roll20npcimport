All dhampirs have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution: Dhampirs are fast and seductive, but closer to death than most mortals.

Light Sensitivity: Dhampires are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell. Negative Energy Affinity: Dhampires are alive, but are healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy, as if they were an undead creature.
Spell-Like Ability: A dhampir can use detect undead three times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability equals the dhampir’s class level. Resist Level Drain: A dhampir takes no penalties from energy draining effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels then he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a dhampir takes are removed without the need for an additional saving throw.
