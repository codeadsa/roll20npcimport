SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Courage (Su) A pavbagha is immune to fear, magical or otherwise. Each ally within 10 feet of it gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the pavbagha is conscious, not if it’s unconscious or dead.
Fade (Su) As a standard action, a pavbagha can fade from sight, as invisibility, for up to 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.
Stunning Claw (Ex) This ability functions like the Stunning Fist feat, except the pavbagha uses a claw attack instead of an unarmed strike. The servitor can use this ability five times per day. A successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw negates this effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
