SPECIAL ABILITIES
Freeze (Ex) A green guardian can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A green guardian that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.
Reanimation (Ex) The eyes of a green guardian gargoyle are made of two pieces of jet (500 gp each) that detect as both magic (faint conjuration) and evil. After being destroyed, a green guardian automatically reanimates in 1d8+2 days unless the eye gems are crushed and disenchanted with both dispel magic (DC 15) and remove curse.
