SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shatter Swarm (Ex) Whenever a bottled armada fires its ballistae, swarms a creature, or is dealt weapon damage, one of the containing bottles shatters, spraying glass in a circle around it. All creatures in a 5-foot radius take 1d6 points of piercing damage. A successful DC 13 Reflex save (DC 13) halves the damage.
