SPECIAL ABILITIES
Invisible in Shadows (Ex) When a ghost-faced orc stands still or moves slowly (no more than 5 feet per round) in shadowy illumination or complete darkness, it becomes effectively invisible to all natural and extraordinary sight, including darkvision and other sight-based senses. A ghost-faced orc invisible in shadows can still be detected by hearing and smell. A true seeing spell (or other similar magic) reveals its location as well.
