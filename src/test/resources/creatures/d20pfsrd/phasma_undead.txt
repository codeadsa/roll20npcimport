SPECIAL ABILITIES
Phantasmagoria (Su) Twice per day, a phasma can create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to each subject within 30 feet. This effect is identical to a phantasmal killer spell (caster level 13th) except it affects all creatures within 30 feet rather than just a single target and deals 6d6 points of damage (rather than 3d6 like the spell) on a successful Fortitude save. The Will save has a DC of 21 and the Fortitude save has a DC of 21. A creature that succeeds on its Will save is immune to the phantasmagoria attack of that phasma for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Wisdom Drain (Su) A phasma feeds on the mental strength of its enemies. Its incorporeal touch deals 1d6 points of Wisdom drain each time one of its attacks hits. On each successful attack, a phasma gains 5 temporary hit points.
