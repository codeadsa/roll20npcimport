SPECIAL ABILITIES
Absorbent Hide (Ex)
A flood troll’s flesh is highly resilient to the stresses of long dry periods. A flood troll who has gone without touching flowing water for at least 24 hours gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. A flood troll who has touched water within the last 24 hours gains cold resistance 5 instead.
Over-sized Limbs (Ex)
A flood troll’s hands are larger than its body would suggest. Flood trolls can wield Large weapons without penalty.
Rain Regeneration (Ex)
A flood troll’s regeneration functions as long as the flood troll is touching flowing water or precipitation.
Even a slight drizzle is enough to activate the flood troll’s regeneration. However, any acid or fire damage dealt to the flood troll suspends its next round of regeneration.
