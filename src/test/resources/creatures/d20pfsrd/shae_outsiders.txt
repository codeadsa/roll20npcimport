SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Su) A shae’s touch saps heat from living creatures, leaving patches of colorless flesh rather than physical wounds. A shae can deal 1d6 points of cold damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to any melee weapon damage it deals.
Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp) This spell-like ability functions identically to the spell shadow evocation, but it can only create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
