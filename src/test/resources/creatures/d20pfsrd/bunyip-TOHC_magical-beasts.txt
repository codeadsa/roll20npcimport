SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frenzy (Ex) A bunyip that detects blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy, as do all other bunyips within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied bunyips attack until either they or their opponents are dead.
A frenzied bunyip can make one extra attack when making a full attack action. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack. Additionally, it gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (none of which are included in the statistic block above). A frenzied bunyip’s swim speed increases by 10 feet (to 60 feet). This frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds) and can only be used once per encounter.
Keen Scent (Ex) Bunyips can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to one-half mile.
Roar (Su) When a bunyip roars, all creatures with 4 or less HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the roar of that bunyip for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Vorpal Bite (Ex) If a bunyip scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and confirms the critical hit, it severs one of the opponent’s extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).
