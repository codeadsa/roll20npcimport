SPECIAL ABILITIES
Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a kirin.
Hooves (Ex) The kirin treats its hooves as primary weapons.
Smite Chaos (Su) Once per day, as a swift action, a kirin can designate one chaotic creature it can see as the target of its smite chaos ability. Until the creature is dead, or the kirin rests, it adds the following: 1) its Charisma bonus to attack rolls; and 2) a damage bonus to attacks equal to its Hit Dice.
Spirits of the Air (Su) When a kirin summons a creature with a fly speed or the air subtype, the creature gains a +4 bonus to its Strength and Constitution scores.
Storm Horn (Ex) The horn of a kirin is exceedingly sharp. The kirin adds double its Strength modifier to melee damage from the horn and the horn’s critical threat range is 18-20.
Whisper on the Wind (Su) As a move action, the kirin can become invisible and incorporeal. As long as it is in this state, the kirin can move double its speed. The kirin can resume its normal state with a free action.
