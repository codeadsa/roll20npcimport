SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Gaze (Su) 1d4 negative levels, 30 feet; Fortitude DC 20 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid slain by a bodak’s death gaze rises as a bodak 24 hours later. This is a death effect.
Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to direct sunlight deals 2d6 points of damage to a bodak.
