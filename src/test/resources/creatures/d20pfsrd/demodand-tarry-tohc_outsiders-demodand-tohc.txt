SPECIAL ABILITIES
Adhesive (Ex) A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability.
A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.
Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies.
Rage (Ex) A tarry demodand that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and –4 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.
While raging, make the following adjustments to the tarry demodand’s statistics:
AC 23, touch 11, flat-footed 18; CMB +20 (+28 grapple); CMD 35; Melee 2 claws +21 melee (1d6+9), bite +20 melee (1d8+9); Str 28
