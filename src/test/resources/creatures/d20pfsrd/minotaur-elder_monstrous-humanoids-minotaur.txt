TACTICS
Before Combat Minotaur elders use their spell-like abilities extensively before combat to prepare the area for a coming battle, littering the battlefield with glyphs of warding and using stone shape to create pits and traps.
During Combat Like ordinary minotaurs, minotaur elders begin combat with a terrifying charge attack, using its Power Attack and Impaling Charge feats to attempt to kill or grapple a foe. A minotaur elder uses its wall of stone and fog cloud spell-like abilities to divide or confuse his foes and uses Vital Strike when forced to move before attacking. It attacks any foes it is unable to reach with its double crossbow. Its maze ability is reserved for the most deadly opponent or the last foe, so the elder might toy with the trapped foe.
Morale Minotaur elders attempt to flee if reduced to 5 hp or less.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Maze Mastery (Su) Minotaur elders possess a supernatural cunning when in the confines of a maze or labyrinth. In such areas they receive a +4 bonus on initiative checks and a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks. In addition, a minotaur elder may enter a maze spell as it is being cast along with the intended target so long as the target is within 30 feet. This includes maze spells cast by the minotaur elder. Once inside, the minotaur elder can leave the maze as a move action. The minotaur elder and the target appear at opposite ends of a 30-foot-square chamber where all exits lead to the maze itself (and the only way out for the target).
Natural Cunning (Ex) Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to maze spells and prevents them from ever becoming lost. A minotaur elder’s natural cunning ability protects it from ever being caught flat-footed.
