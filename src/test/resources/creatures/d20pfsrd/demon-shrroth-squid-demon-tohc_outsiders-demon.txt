SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sickening Cloud (Ex) A shrroth can emit a cloud of grayish liquid in a 40-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides concealment and any creature in the area or entering the area must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save or be sickened for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Jet (Ex) A shrroth can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
