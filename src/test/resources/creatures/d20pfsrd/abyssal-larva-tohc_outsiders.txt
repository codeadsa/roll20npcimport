SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) Abyssal larvae use digestive juices to break down their foods. This acid often remains in their mouths and is transferred to a victim bitten by a larva. Any melee bite attack deals acid damage.
Maggot Spray (Ex) Once per day, an abyssal larva can regurgitate and fire a stream of maggots at a single opponent within 10 feet. This requires the abyssal larva to succeed on a ranged touch attack. If the attack succeeds, the opponent is sickened for 1d2 rounds. A successful DC 10 Reflex save reduces the sickened condition to 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
Tortured Mind (Ex) The mind of an abyssal larva is a warped and tangled mass of chaos. As a result, abyssal larvae are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). A creature attempting to contact an abyssal larva with a mind-affecting spell or effect (including psionics) must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as by a confusion spell for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
