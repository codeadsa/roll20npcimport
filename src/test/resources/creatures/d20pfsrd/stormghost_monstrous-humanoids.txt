SPECIAL ABILITIES
Adaptive Camouflage (Ex) A stormghost’s hide shifts coloration over time to match its environment, granting it +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks within the ranger favored terrain type matching its current terrain. A stormghost moving to a different terrain must stay 1d4 weeks to gain the bonus.
Impaling Leap (Ex) As a standard action, a stormghost can leap onto a target at least one size category smaller than itself and impale the victim.
The target suffers 6d8+16 points of piercing damage and is pinned (DC 26 Reflex negates). The stormghost must maintain the pin as normal. Pinned foes take impaling leap damage each round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Static Aura (Su) A stormghost can surround itself with crackling electricity that leaps from its body. All creatures within 5 feet of the stormghost take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the stormghost’s turn. A stormghost can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Static Blast (Su) As a standard action, a stormghost can focus its static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals 15d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex save halves this damage. A stormghost can use its static blast once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
