SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cerberus’s Jaws (Su) Curse—bite; save Fort DC 18; effect dimensional anchoring. A creature affected by this curse cannot utilize extradimensional travel such as teleport, as if it were under the effect of a dimensional anchor spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Soul Scent (Su) This ability functions as the scent ability, save that it also grants the cerberi a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks made to track undead. This ability even allows a cerberi to track the passage of an incorporeal creature.
