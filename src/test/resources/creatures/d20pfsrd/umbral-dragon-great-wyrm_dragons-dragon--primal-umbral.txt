SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Although it deals negative energy damage, an umbral dragon’s breath weapon does not heal undead creatures.
Create Shadows (Su) Any creature slain by an ancient or older umbral dragon rises as a shadow (if 8 HD or less) or greater shadow (if above 8 HD) under the umbral dragon’s control 1d4 rounds later.
Energy Drain (Su) A great wyrm umbral dragon deals 1 negative level with each successful bite or claw attack (1 level, DC 32).
Ghost Bane (Su) A young or older umbral dragon’s physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally.
Shadow Breath (Su) Three times per day, an adult or older umbral dragon can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the dragon. A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points.
Umbral Scion (Ex) Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are immune to energy drain and death effects.
