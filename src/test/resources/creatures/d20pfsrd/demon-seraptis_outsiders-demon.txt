SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Healing (Su) Whenever a creature within 30 feet of a seraptis takes bleed damage caused by that seraptis, the blood flows through the air into the seraptis’s maw, and the seraptis heals an equal amount of damage.
Compelling Domination (Su) When a seraptis uses dominate person, its victims do not actively resist and never gain a new saving throw when ordered to take actions against their nature.
Gaze of Despair (Su) Creatures within 30 feet of a seraptis that fail a DC 22 Will save take 1d6 points of Charisma drain and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. If the Charisma drain would reduce a creature’s Charisma to 0, that creature instead succumbs to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most convenient method at hand, subject to the GM’s discretion. The creature remains in that state until its Charisma is restored to its normal maximum—otherwise, the victim must be restrained at all times to prevent further suicide attempts.
This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Multi-Arm Grab (Ex) When a seraptis successfully grabs a creature, the maws on her arms begin to gnaw on it. This ability functions as constrict, except the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. A seraptis gains a cumulative +4 bonus on grapple attempts with her grab ability for each successive claw attack after the first that hits a given target that round.
