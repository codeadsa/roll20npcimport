SPECIAL ABILITIES
Beguiling Dance (Ex) An amanusya can attempt a Perform (dance) skill check in place of a concentration check to cast defensively or in place of an Acrobatics check to move through threatened squares. Once per round, when an amanusya succeeds at a Perform (dance) check to move through a square threatened by a foe, she can immediately attempt a feint against that foe as a free action.
Swift Change (Su) An amanusya can change shape as a swift action, but only when revealing her true form.
