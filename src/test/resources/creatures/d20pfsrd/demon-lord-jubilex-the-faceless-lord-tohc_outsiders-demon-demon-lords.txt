TACTICS
When confronted, he usually takes the form of a 12-foot tall column of bubbling and squirting ooze. Jubilex weighs about 6,000 pounds. Jubilex lashes out with a slimy appendage, attempting to grab and constrict opponents. Grabbed creatures are crushed and cast aside, to be dissolved and devoured at a later time. Jubilex can flatten his body, thereby enabling him to squeeze through cracks and openings of Tiny or larger size.
