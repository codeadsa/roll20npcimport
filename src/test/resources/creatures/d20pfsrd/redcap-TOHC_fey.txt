TACTICS
Redcaps hate humans and most other good-aligned fey creatures (especially brownies, grigs, and pixies). Though not combat-minded, they often go out of their way to kill good-aligned fey if given the chance. Redcaps sometimes work with evil fey such as grimstalkers, but such alliances are usually short-lived.
Hunting bands are not uncommon, especially at night, and during these hunts redcaps are most often encountered carrying their poisoned daggers (which they use to fell opponents larger or stronger than themselves). They enjoy traveling into civilized areas and stealing livestock and pets, just to see the sorrowful looks on the faces of the farmers and children the next day when they find their animals missing or slaughtered.
