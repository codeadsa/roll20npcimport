SPECIAL ABILITIES
Copper Boar Form (Su) When a chalkost uses its change shape ability, it can turn into a boar with metallic flesh, coppery bristles, and glistening steel tusks. In this form, a chalkost retains its damage reduction and energy resistances. The copper boar has the same statistics as a normal boar, but its natural armor bonus is +6 and its gore attack deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit.
Dwarf Blood (Ex) A chalkost counts as a dwarf for any effect related to race, and has the hardy, slow and steady, and stability dwarven racial traits.
Shock Cestus (Su) As a free action, a chalkost can summon or dismiss a masterwork cestus on one of its hands. While wielded by the chalkost, the cestus deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. If the cestus is given away or taken, the chalkost loses this ability until it reclaims its weapon.
