SPECIAL ABILITIES
Corrupt Scroll (Su) An ink devil can corrupt the magic within any scroll by touch. Any such corrupted scroll requires a DC 16 CL check to use successfully. If the check fails, the scroll’s spell affects the caster if it is a ranged spell or affects the nearest devil if it is a personal spell.
Devil’s Mark (Ex) Ink devils can throw ink from their fingertips as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the affected creature takes no damage but gains a devil’s mark—a black, red, or purple tattoo in the shape of an archduke’s personal seal. Any devil’s magic performed against the marked creature gains a +4 competency bonus due to the mark, including touch spells, innate spell-like or supernatural abilities (which increase their save DC by 4), and magic drawn from a scroll or other item by a devil. The mark can be removed only by remove curse (CL 7th), followed immediately by erase (that must make a CL check against a 4th-level caster). In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and clerics of an inquisition may consider such a mark proof that a character has made a pact with a devil.
Disrupt Concentration (Ex) Their sharp, shrill tongues and sharper claws make ink devils more distracting than their own combat prowess might indicate. As a swift action, an ink devil can force a single foe to make a DC 16 concentration check or suffer spell failure for a spell cast that round. This is a sonic effect and is Cha-based.
