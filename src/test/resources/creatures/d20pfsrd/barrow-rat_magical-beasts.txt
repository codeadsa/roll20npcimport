TACTICS
Barrow rats rarely engage in combat with creatures much larger than themselves, preferring to flee when confronted. Smaller creatures are attacked from ambush and swarmed by the rats.
If threatened or cornered, a barrow rat activates its stone skin ability for defense and either attacks with its bite or simply flees. Multiple barrow rats swarm an opponent. If their nest or young are threatened, barrow rats fight to the death.
