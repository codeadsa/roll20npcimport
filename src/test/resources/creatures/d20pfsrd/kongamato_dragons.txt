SPECIAL ABILITIES
Piercing Beak (Ex) A kongamato’s beak is extremely hard and adept at breaking objects. When attempting to damage an item, a kongamato’s beak attack does double damage and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the object’s hardness.
Wailing Dive (Su) When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack feat, the creature’s body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to deal an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.
