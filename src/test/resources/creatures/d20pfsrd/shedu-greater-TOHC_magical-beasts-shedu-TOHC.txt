SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A shedu can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move-equivalent action. This ability is otherwise identical with the ethereal jaunt spell (caster level 18th).
Magic Circle against Evil (Su) A greater shedu radiates a continuous magic circle against evil at caster level 14th. This effect can be dispelled, but the greater shedu can resume the magic circle as a free action at will.
