SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Carnage (Su) All critical threats within 30 feet of a lejnth gain a +4 bonus to the confirmation roll. A successful critical hit within this aura inflicts maximum damage. This ability grants the lejnth Critical Focus as a bonus feat but does not affect attacks made against lejnth.
Battle Concentration (Ex) The mind of the lejnth is extremely focused. Whenever a lejnth is aware of an opponent, it receives a +4 racial bonus to Will saves against mind-affecting effects.
Blade Shower (Sp) Three times per day, a lejnth can blast pieces of its armor at foes in a rain of razor-sharp steel. The blade shower strikes all creatures in a 30-foot cone and deals 6d6 points of piercing and slashing damage. A DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage. Any armor lost in the shower regrows instantly. The save DC is Constitution based.
Razor Armor (Ex) A lejnth’s steel armor sports razor-sharp edges and spikes. Any creature touching a lejnth takes 1d6 slashing damage. This includes attacks with natural weapons and grapple attempts.
