SPECIAL ABILITIES
Brand of the Impenitent (Su) Three times per day, a balisse angel can brand a judged individual within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be branded with a painless, glowing icon on its chest—usually the holy symbol of the deity or empyreal lord the balisse angel serves. This brand lasts for a number of days equal to the balisse angel’s Hit Dice (10 days for most balisse angels). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target’s spell resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.
