SPECIAL ABILITIES Draw Essence (Su) Once per day, an arusities can draw the essence from one evil living creature. This deals 1d3 Charisma damage.
Inert (Ex) An arusities can become inert and appear as a simple doll. When inert, she does not radiate an aura of evil and an observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice that the doll-like demon is actually alive.
Summoning Arusities It is neither magic ritual nor spell that summons the arusities from the pits of Hell, but desire. Specifically, an arusities is drawn to the Material Plane by the desires of a child who wants for nothing, yet still wants more. This young, primal greed pulls the arusities into the lives of selfish children.
