SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Ex) A gelid beetle’s body generates cold that deals an extra 1d4 points of cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
Cold Spray (Ex) Once per day a gelid beetle can release a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 points of cold damage. Those within the cone who succeed a DC 13 Fortitude save take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
