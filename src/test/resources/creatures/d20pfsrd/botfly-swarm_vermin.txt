Infestation (Ex) A living creature injured by a botfly swarm’s attack must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be infested with the swarm’s larvae. The larvae may be cut out of the host with a DC 15 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d8 points of damage whether or not it’s successful. A remove disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host.
Botfly larvae: infestation; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage.
