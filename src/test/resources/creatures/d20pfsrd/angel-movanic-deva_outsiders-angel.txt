SPECIAL ABILITIES
Nature’s Pacifism (Ex) Animals and plant creatures do not willingly attack a movanic deva, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the deva attacks a plant or animal, its protection against that creature ends.
Protected Life Force (Ex) Movanic devas are never harmed by positive-dominant or negative-dominant planar traits.
