SPECIAL ABILITIES
Armored Stomach (Ex) A giant snapping turtle’s body is difficult to cut through—its stomach gains a +4 bonus to its AC and has double the normal hit points when determining the success of a creature attempting to cut its way free.
Shell (Ex) As a move action, a snapping turtle can pull its extremities and head into its shell. It cannot move or attack as long as it remains in this state, but its armor bonus from natural armor increases by +4 as long as it does.
