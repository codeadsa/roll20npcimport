SPECIAL ABILITIES
Daze (Ex) Any creature hit by a jack-in-iron’s melee attack must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be dazed 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based and is a function of the jack-in-irons not its weapon(s).
Pound (Ex) A jack-in-irons that makes a successful grapple check against a foe two or more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A jack-in-irons can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.
Shake the Earth (Ex) As a standard action, a jack-in-irons can stomp its foot on the ground causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature within 5 feet of the jack-in-irons must succeed on a DC 36 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Strength-based.
