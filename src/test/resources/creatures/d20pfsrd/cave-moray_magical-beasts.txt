SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ambush (Ex) If a cave moray surprises its opponent, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its attack roll for that round.
Recoil Attack (Ex) A cave moray lunges out of its cyst up to 5 feet to strike at passing opponents or prey. This attack is swift enough to attack running or flying creatures. A cave morayâ€™s recoil attack is always considered a charge attack since it recoils into its cyst after an attack to lunge at its opponent again.
