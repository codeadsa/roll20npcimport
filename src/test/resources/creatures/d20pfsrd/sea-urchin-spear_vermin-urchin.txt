SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Spines—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str and nauseated for 1 round; cure 1 save.
Spines (Ex) When a creature attacks a spear urchin with an unarmed strike or natural attack, or with a manufactured melee weapon while adjacent to the urchin, the urchin automatically gains a free attack with its spines. In addition, a spear urchin can fire up to 2 spines each round with a range increment of 30 feet. As long as its target is within 30 feet, a spear urchin ignores Dexterity and size penalties on ranged attack rolls, but beyond this range the penalties function normally. A spear urchin’s spines function equally well underwater and above water.
