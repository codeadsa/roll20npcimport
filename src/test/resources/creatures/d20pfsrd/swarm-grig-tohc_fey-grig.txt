SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fiddle (Su) The grigs that make up a grig swarm carry tiny, grig-sized fiddles. When the fiddlers play, any non-fey within 30 feet of the instruments must make a successful DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by irresistible dance for as long as the playing continues. The save DC is Charisma-based.
