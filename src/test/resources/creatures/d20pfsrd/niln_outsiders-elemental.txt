SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drench (Ex) The niln’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the niln’s HD).
Vapor Form (Su) The niln spends the majority of its time in more or less solid form, but it can assume vapor form at will. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in vapor form. A niln in vapor form can fly at 60 feet per round (perfect). This ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell (caster level 5th).
