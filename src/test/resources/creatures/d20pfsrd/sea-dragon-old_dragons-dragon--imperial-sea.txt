SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A young or older sea dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Sea Strider (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, an old or older sea dragon can move from one body of water to another as if using the teleport spell (self only).
Torrent Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of super-heated steam, a very young or older sea dragon can breathe a line of pressurized water twice the length of the sea dragon’s cone breath weapon. This line deals bludgeoning damage.
Unfettered Swimmer (Su) A juvenile sea dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its swim speed. The sea dragon’s swim speed continues to increase by an additional 10 feet every two age categories. Furthermore, while swimming, the sea dragon is treated as if under the effects of the spell freedom of movement.
