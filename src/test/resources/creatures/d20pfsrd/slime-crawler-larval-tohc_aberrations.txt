SPECIAL ABILITIES
Slippery (Ex) A slime crawler exudes a thin, oily film from the glands beneath its mouth that leaves a slug-like trail behind it as its moves and provides the creature with a +6 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks. A creature stepping in a space covered with this slime must succeed on a DC 11 Reflex save or slip and fall prone. The slime remains in the area for 1d2 hours before losing its potency. The save DC is Constitution-based.
