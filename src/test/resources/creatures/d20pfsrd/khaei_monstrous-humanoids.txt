SPECIAL ABILITIES
Lost Time (Su) As a touch attack, a khaei can touch a creature and prematurely age it. The creature touched must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be permanently aged 1d10 years. This effect also deals 1d4 points of damage to the khaei. Effects from multiple khaei stack, though a single khaei can use this power on a given opponent only once.
