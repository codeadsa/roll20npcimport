SPECIAL ABILITIES
Slick Spittle (Ex) By spending 2 rounds dribbling spittle on an area, an eel hound can cover a 5-ft. square with its slippery saliva. This area is treated as if under the effects of grease, but it lasts for 1 hour.
Slithering Bite (Ex) When an eel hound moves adjacent to an enemy and makes a bite attack, it may immediately make a 5-ft. step into an adjacent square next to its enemy. If another eel hound already occupies that square, it can continue on to the first empty square still adjacent to that same enemy.
