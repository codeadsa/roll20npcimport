SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.
Spit Molten Brass (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds (and no more than five times per day), a brass man can spit a stream of molten brass in a 30-foot line; damage 6d6 fire, Reflex half DC 15. The save DC is Constitution-based.
