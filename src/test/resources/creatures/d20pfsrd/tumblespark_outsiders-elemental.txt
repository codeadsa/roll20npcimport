TACTICS
Individual tumblesparks are drawn to positively charged beings such as those wearing large amounts of metal armor. They slam into them discharging blast after blast of electrical energy until the positively charged victim loses its own charge usually as a result of the victim’s demise. Against smaller foes, a tumblespark simply rolls over them, dealing crushing and electricity damage.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Arc (Ex) Once per round, a tumblespark can release a jolt of electricity against a single opponent within 10 feet that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Insubstantial Form (Ex) A tumblespark’s natural form is a ball of dancing and arcing electricity; it is not solid, nor is it incorporeal. Any piercing or slashing attack has a 20% miss chance against a tumblespark. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.
