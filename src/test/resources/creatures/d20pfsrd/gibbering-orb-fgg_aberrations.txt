SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eye Rays (Su) Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray each round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below (CL 27th.) The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 ft. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh to stone, greater dispel magic, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage’s disjunction, irresistible dance, baleful polymorph, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and temporal stasis.
Flight (Ex) The gibbering orb’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.
Gibbering (Su) The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 ft. of the creature to succeed at a DC 29 Will save each round or suffer the effects of an insanity spell.
Steal Spell/Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature’s known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.
