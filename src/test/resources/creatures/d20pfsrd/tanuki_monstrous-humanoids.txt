SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sake Affinity (Su) As a swift action, a tanuki can take a swig of sake from the gourd it always carries at its side. When it does so, it gains the effect of one of the following spells at caster level 7th: divine favor, false life, haste, or rage. Unusual tanukis might have additional spell effect choices at the GM’s discretion. Each time a tanuki takes a swig of sake, it becomes progressively drunker and takes a -1 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saves for 1 minute. These penalties stack.
