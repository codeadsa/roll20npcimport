SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold Iron Construction Due to the arcane cold iron forging of a feyward tree, its natural attacks and flaying leaves special ability overcome DR as if they were cold iron and magic.
Flaying Leaves (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a feyward tree can launch a barrage of razor-sharp cold iron leaves from its branches in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures caught within this area take 6d6 slashing damage (Reflex DC 17 halves; Con-based).
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A feyward tree is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow SR. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.
A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a feyward tree (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the feyward tree and heals 1 point for each 3 damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the feyward tree to exceed its full normal hp, it gains any excess as temporary hp. A feyward tree gets no saving throw against electricity effects. Composed mostly of rusted cold iron, a feyward tree is not affected by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
