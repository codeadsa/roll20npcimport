SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A fire elemental dragon’s breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of elemental fire.
Fiery Aura (Ex) Anyone within 60 feet of an elemental fire dragon must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage from the intense heat. The save DC is Constitution-based. Combustibles automatically catch fire if they contact an elemental fire dragon.
Rain of Fire (Ex) As a standard action, a hovering elemental fire dragon can rapidly beat its wings causing fire to rain down on an area in a 100-foot radius. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 2d8 points of fire damage as clothes catch fire or armor and weapons become searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d8 rounds after the attack or until the flames are extinguished. Combustibles in the area automatically catch on fire.
