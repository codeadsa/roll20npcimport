SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.
Poison (Ex) Injury—bite; save Fortitude DC 16; frequency 1/minute for 10 minutes; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC is Constitution-based.
