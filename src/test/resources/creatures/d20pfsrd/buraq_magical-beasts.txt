Before you stands a noble mount with a proud and regal bearing. It has the strong body of a mule, pure white in color, with shining black hooves and the glittering, iridescent wings and tail of a peacock. With a dignified bow of its richly adorned human head, it spreads its powerful wings wide in a fan of shimmering colors.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drink the Wind (Su) Once per day, a buraq may fill its lungs with air and release an explosive gust of wind in a line 150 feet long. Any creature caught by the wind takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is affected by windstorm-strength winds, possibly suffering other effects. A DC 18 Reflex save negates both the damage and the effects of the wind. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Shimmering Wings (Su) A buraq can flutter its iridescent wings to create a pattern of subtle, shifting colors around its body. Any creature within 60 feet who can see the buraq must make a DC 17 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. A creature that makes the save is immune to the shimmering wings of that buraq for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting pattern and affects up to 24 HD of creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Static Field (Su) Three times per day, a buraq can surround itself (and its rider, if any) with a coruscating aura of static electricity that deflects Medium or smaller ranged attacks. This ability functions like an entropic shield and lasts for 1 minute.
Fold the Earth (Su) Once per day, a buraq can transport itself over great distances. This functions as a teleport spell (caster level 6th) with the usual chances of success or mishap. However, a buraq can teleport itself to any location that it can see (usually as far as the horizon, or approximately 200 miles) as if that location were “studied carefully.”
