TACTICS
A renzer usually initiates combat with its spell-like abilities, using a cone of cold to blast its foes. In melee combat, a renzer focuses on bite attacks and once it locks its teeth on an opponent, it rarely lets go until either it or its opponent is dead. If fighting a surface-dwelling race or air-breathing creature, a renzer often grabs the opponent and dives straight down, swimming as fast as it can in hopes of drowning the foe. If outnumbered or overwhelmed, the renzer moves a safe distance away and uses its command fish ability.
