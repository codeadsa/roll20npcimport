SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Each type of mephit can unleash a particular breath weapon every 4 rounds as a standard action. The DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
The breath weapon of a salt mephit is a cone of salt crystals that deals 1d4 slashing damage. The salt also causes living creatures to be sickened for 3 rounds. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect.
Dehydrate (Su) Once per day a salt mephit can draw the moisture from an area in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Living creatures within range take 2d8 points of damage (Fortitude DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This effect is especially devastating to plant and aquatic creatures, which take a –2 penalty on their saving throws. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell
