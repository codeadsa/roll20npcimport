TACTICS
Troblins are a disorganized lot, and rarely engage in any sort of formal tactics or strategy. When a troblin war band encounters opponents, they simply attack with as much strength and ferocity as they can muster. Troblins are even more craven and cowardly than goblins, and a lone troblin usually runs from any combat in which it is outnumbered.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mutation (Ex) The regenerative ability of a troblin does not function as well as those of its trollish parent. Sometimes when an injured troblin regenerates, its body warps in an inexplicable fashion. A severed arm may regrow as two arms, or a scar may grow to cover the troblinâ€™s entire body in thick skin. Further, if a troblin suffers a critical hit in melee, it has a 25% chance of gaining a mutation once it is fully healed.
