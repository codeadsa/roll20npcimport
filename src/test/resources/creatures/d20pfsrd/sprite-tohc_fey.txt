TACTICS
Sprites are shy and reclusive, avoiding contact with other races; only druids have regular contact with sprites, and indeed many druids get their training from sprites. However, sprites detest evil and attack it on sight with their weapons, preferring to strike from ambush while invisible. If possible, they render their victim unconscious using their envenomed arrows, then spirit the creature away to some remote location where it is placed without weapons or gear and left to fend for itself. Creatures that have demonstrated especially evil characteristics may be slain outright, however.
Unlike their pixie cousins, sprites are not especially mischievous by nature, and prefer to be left alone.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immortal (Ex) Sprites are one of the few races that are truly immortal, never aging. They cannot die from natural causes. They still need to eat, sleep, and breathe, and can be killed normally.
Poison Use (Ex) A sprite is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They use sprite poison on their arrows.
Sprite Poison Type injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/min. for 2 min.; effect unconscious 1 minute/2d4 hours; cure 1 save.
Speak with Animals (Su) Sprites can communicate with animals as the spell of the same name. This innate supernatural ability is always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.
