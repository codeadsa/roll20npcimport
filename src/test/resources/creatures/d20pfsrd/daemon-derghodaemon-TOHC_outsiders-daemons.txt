SPECIAL ABILITIES
Feeblemind (Su) Twice per day, by clattering its mandibles together, a derghodaemon can affect all creatures within 30 ft. as if by a feeblemind spell. Daemons are immune to this effect, but all other creatures must make a DC 18 Will save to resist its effects. The effect lasts for 6 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Tear (Ex) If a derghodaemon grapples an opponent, it automatically hits its opponent with all of its melee attacks each round following that it maintains its hold.
