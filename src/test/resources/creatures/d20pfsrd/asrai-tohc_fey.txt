TACTICS
During Combat An asrai only engages in combat if its body of water is threatened, or if any intelligent creature other than a fey enters the water without permission.
Once in combat, an asrai prefers to attack with its magic, using its chilling touch only as a last resort. If it faces overwhelming odds, an asrai seeks escape, often using its fog cloud or obscuring mist ability to cover its exit.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold Touch (Su) The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an asrai’s natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
Water Dependent (Su) An asrai can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, it begins to suffocate. Lost Constitution points are immediately restored if the asrai returns to the water. If its Constitution reaches 0 it dies, collapsing into a puddle of water.
