SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eldritch Surge (Su) A Quantium golem can hurl a lance of eldritch energy that deals 30d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 240-foot line (Reflex DC 25 for half ).
The crimson Quantium golem deals half electricity and half fire damage, and slows a creature (as the slow spell) that fails its save for 2d4 rounds.
The green Quantium golem deals half acid and half fire damage, and nauseates any creature that fails its save for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A Quantium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted.
A magical attack that deals cold damage against the crimson golem or electricity damage against the green golem slows it (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. A Quantium golem and its equipment are immune to rust attacks. Link (Su) Each Quantium golem always knows the exact location of the other.
Urban Defender (Su) A Quantium golem gains 150 bonus hit points as long as it’s within 1 mile of the city. If it moves beyond this range, it loses these bonus hit points.
