SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A clockwork leviathan’s breath weapon is a powerful jet of scorching steam—it functions equally well above and under water.
Grind (Ex) A clockwork leviathan deals an additional 1d8+16 points of slashing damage when it makes a successful grapple check because of the myriad twisting gears and churning pistons that make up its jagged underbelly.
Swallow Whole (Ex) A clockwork leviathan’s interior is filled with injurious grinding gears and superheated water—in addition to taking damage, a swallowed creature must hold its breath or risk drowning as long as it remains inside a clockwork leviathan’s “stomach.”
