SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electricity (Ex) Once per hour, an electric eel can produce a jolt of electricity in a 10-foot radius centered on its body. Creatures within 5 feet take 3d8 points of electricity damage. Those further away than 5 feet but within 10 feet take 2d8 points of electricity damage. Affected creatures can make a DC 13 Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. Electric eels are immune to their own electrical attacks and that of other electric eels. The save DC is Constitution-based.
