SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for
4 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
A creature that dies from this poison turns into water and flows away (and is irrevocably dead save for a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Watersense (Ex) A pelagos can pinpoint the location of anything within 60 feet that is touching the water.
Editor’s Note
There is no feat called Fast Swim; GM’s should feel free to ignore this feat since the creature already has more than its requisite number of feats. Base Creature
Sea Spider
