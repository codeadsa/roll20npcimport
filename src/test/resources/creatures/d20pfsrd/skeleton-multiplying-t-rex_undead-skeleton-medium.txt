SPECIAL ABILITIES
Multiplication (Su) When a multiplying skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points, its bones reform 1d4 rounds later into two smaller multiplying skeletons with 9 Hit Dice each. Each resulting multiplying skeleton continues to reform into smaller and smaller sizes (with half the HD of the previous each time it multiplies.) A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton reforms into two Large skeletons with 9 HD each, each of which then reforms into two Small skeletons with 4 HD each. When these four Small skeletons are killed, the skeleton no longer multiplies and is finally destroyed.
Powerful Bite (Ex) A multiplying tyrannosaurus skeleton applies twice its Strength modifier to bite damage.
