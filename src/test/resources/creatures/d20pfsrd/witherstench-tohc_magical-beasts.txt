SPECIAL ABILITIES
Stench (Ex) A witherstench constantly emits a putrid stench that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except witherstenches) within 30 feet of a witherstench must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Moving out of the affected area leaves the character sickened for 1 round after which time he recovers immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same witherstenchâ€™s stench for 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
