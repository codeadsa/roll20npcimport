SPECIAL ABILITIES Blood-Draining Gaze (Su) All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet walker are subject to the monster’s eerie blood-draining gaze. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes, flowing through the air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet walker’s face. This does not impact the victim’s vision, but does deal 1 point of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a –4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Bloodsense (Su) A scarlet walker can sense living creatures with blood in their veins, or undead creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability functions like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.
