SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Chill (Su) The touch of the midnight peddler deals 1d4 negative levels to a living creature. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Constitution-based. The midnight peddler gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed.
Divination (Su) The peddler provides advice and answers correctly any one question asked of him by any creature who buys something from his cart. This ability functions similar to a divination spell (caster level 12th).
Plane Shift (Su) The midnight peddler can plane shift (as the spell) to any inner or outer plane as a move action. His cart (and any non-living matter contained therein) shifts with him. This ability otherwise functions as the spell of the same name.
