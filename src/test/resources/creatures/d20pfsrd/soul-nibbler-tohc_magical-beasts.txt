Essence Ingots
Essence ingots are small rectangular bricks of blackened stone that contain the soul of a living creature. Creatures are trapped in essence ingots through the use of a great smelter, the location of which has been lost.
A trapped spirit can be released by casting remove curse (or similar and more powerful magic). A released soul reforms its material body in 1d4 rounds. An essence ingot has a hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 20. Note, however, that if an essence ingot is broken, the trapped soul is not released but is lost forever.
