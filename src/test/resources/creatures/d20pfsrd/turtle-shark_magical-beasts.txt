TACTICS
A turtle-shark surprises many foes with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if there is blood or activity in the water.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark’s size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Shell (Ex) If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.
