SPECIAL ABILITIES
Flurry of Blows (Ex) Similar to a monk, a slaughterford can make a flurry of blows attack at the expense of accuracy. It can make one extra attack per round as a full attack action, but each attack receives a -2 penalty.
Rend Armor (Ex) If a slaughterford hits with both arm blades, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+6 points of damage to the opponentâ€™s armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.
