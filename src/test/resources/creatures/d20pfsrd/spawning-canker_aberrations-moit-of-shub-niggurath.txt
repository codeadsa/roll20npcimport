SPECIAL ABILITIES
Feeding (Ex) Whenever a spawning canker deals damage to a sentient living creature with its constrict attack, it also deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage as it feeds off the victimâ€™s vital essence. If a spawning canker drains 10 points of Charisma in 1 hour, the canker immediately spawns (see below).
Spawn (Ex) When a spawning canker has drained enough life force, it bursts apart into 2d4+2 slugspawn. These worm-like terrors crawl into nearby shadows and lurk in wait for any potential hosts to come nearby. The spawning canker is destroyed when this occurs. There is a 1% chance that instead of turning into slugspawn, a spawning canker transforms into a dark young of Shub-Niggurath.
