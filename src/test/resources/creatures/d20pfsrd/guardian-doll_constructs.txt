SPECIAL ABILITIES
Doll’s Dagger (Su) The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon and delivers 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child’s toy.
The save DC is Charisma-based.
Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically one of the doll’s eyes or a gem embedded into its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. However, due to the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.
