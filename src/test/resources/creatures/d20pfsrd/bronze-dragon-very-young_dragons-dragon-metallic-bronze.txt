SPECIAL ABILITIES
Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.
