TACTICS
Piranha are highly aggressive and attack in swarms any living creature detected in the water.
Piranha swarms hunt during the day and are usually dormant at night. Some species are ambush hunters and hide in a single clump of seaweed or coral, shooting out to attack prey when it moves nearby. They attack using their razor sharp teeth, biting and gnashing their prey. Once blood is spilt, the piranha swarm enters a killing frenzy.

Killing Frenzy (Ex) A piranha swarm that detects blood in the water enters a frenzied state the following round, along with all other piranha swarms within a 100-foot radius. Frenzied piranha swarms bite until they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied piranha swarm gains a +2 bonus to damage and -2 AC for 1 minute. The swarm cannot end the killing frenzy voluntarily.
