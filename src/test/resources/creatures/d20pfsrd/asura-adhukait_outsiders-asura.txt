SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dance of Disaster (Su) Whenever an adhukait hits with a melee attack during a full-attack action, it can move 10 feet before making its next attack. The adhukait’s normal speed does not limit this movement—it can move 10 feet after any successful hit among its four attacks, as long as it has another attack to make.
Dual Mind (Su) An adhukait is a single creature with two distinct minds, so it can attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If either saving throw succeeds, the mind-affecting effect fails to affect the adhukait.
