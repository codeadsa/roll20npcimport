SPECIAL ABILITIES
Entangling Crown (Sp) The rose and laurel crown is his heraldric symbol. The crown grants him the ability to entangle his foes as the entangle (DC 29) spell. This functions with a caster level of 20th and is heightened to 9th level.
Freedom and Liberty These twin morningstars are gifts from his goddess. When used together, the wielder can make full attacks with both of them at no penalty, and the wielder cannot be disarmed. They are effectively +6 morningstars and grant the wielder a +6 sacred bonus to all ability scores (included in the above statistics).
