SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hypnosis (Su) Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The lunar naga can maintain this fascination effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it moves as long as it maintains the effect by concentrating. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con and 1 Wis*; cure 1 save.
Spells A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
