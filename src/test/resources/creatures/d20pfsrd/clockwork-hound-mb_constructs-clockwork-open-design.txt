SPECIAL ABILITIES
Diligent Tracker (Ex) Clockwork hounds are designed to guard areas and track prey. They gain a +5 racial bonus to Perception checks and Survival checks when tracking.
Whip Tongue (Ex) A mechanism within the clockwork hound’s mouth can make either a nonlethal attack (1d3+3 nonlethal damage), a trip attempt, or a disarm attack against any target it is aware of 1/ round as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity; this is a ranged touch attack. The tongue has a reach of 15 ft. and is considered a two-handed weapon for the trip or disarm attempt; the creature gains a +10 bonus to either attempt. This mechanism explodes when a clockwork hound is destroyed, lashing the cable at each creature within 5 ft. of the construct (2d6 damage, Reflex DC 15 for half).
