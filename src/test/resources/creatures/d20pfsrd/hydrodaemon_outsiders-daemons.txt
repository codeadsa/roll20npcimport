Sleep Spittle (Su) A hydrodaemon can spit at a single target within 20 feet, making a ranged touch attack as a standard action. A target hit by this spittle must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
About this Daemon Type… Giant humanoid-amphibians with oversized claws and dead, glassy eyes, hydrodaemons represent death by drowning. Aquatic in nature, they dwell in Abaddon’s poisonous swamps and acidic oceans, and even in the foul waters of the River Styx. Hydrodaemons number among the few creatures capable of surviving prolonged exposure to the Styx, and they exploit this to lair and set ambushes where few other creatures dare. In their native environment they alternately compete with or serve under piscodaemons, but greatly revere Charon’s thanadaemons, eagerly obeying their requests. Outside of Abaddon, hydrodaemons frequently serve mortal spellcasters to keep watch over aquatic domains, using the same tactics as on their native plane. Powerful creatures in their own right, they prefer to target enemies with their sleep-inducing spittle, then drown those who succumb to the poisoned slumber.
Personification of Death: Drowning.
Preferred Sacrifice: Treasure totaling at least 300 gp, or no fewer than two living victims purposefully bound and hurled into a body of water.
