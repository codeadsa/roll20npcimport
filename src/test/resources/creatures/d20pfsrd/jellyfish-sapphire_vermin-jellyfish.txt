SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electricity Blast (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a sapphire jellyfish can discharge a 20-foot-radius blast of electricity, dealing 8d6 points of electricity damage (DC 22 Reflex for half). Any creature that takes damage from this electricity must also make a DC 22 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1d4 rounds.
Poison (Ex) Tentacle—injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Editor’s Note
As seems to be common for Bestiary 3, this does not indicate Ability Damage or Drain.
