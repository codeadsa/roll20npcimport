SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A dusk kamadan can exhale a cone of gas that makes living creatures fall asleep for 5 minutes (Fortitude DC 17 negates). Slapping or wounding awakens a creature put to sleep by this attack, but normal noise does not. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Snakes (Ex) A dusk kamadan’s snakes attack simultaneously; this is always a secondary attack.
Snakes—injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
