SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Size (Sp) Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Heat (Ex) An efreeti’s body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.
Examples and Variants
Malik (Noble Efreet, CR 10) A small percentage of efreet are noble and are called maliks. They have 13 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like abilities:
3/day—fireball, heat metal; 1/day—greater invisibility, pyroclastic storm (as ice storm, with fire instead of cold damage). A noble efreeti’s caster level for its spell-like abilities is 15th. Noble efreet are CR 10.
