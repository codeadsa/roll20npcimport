SPECIAL ABILITIES
Warp Spell (Su) When a spell directly targets a snail flail, there is a chance the protective minerals in its shell cause the spell to malfunction in some way.
Roll 1d10 to determine what occurs when a spell is cast at the flail snail. Area spells such as fireball are not affected by warp spell.
1d10 Effect
1-2 The spell’s energy backfires and disorients the caster for 1d4 rounds. The caster must make a DC 13 Concentration check to cast a spell while disoriented.
3-4 The spell rebounds and strikes the creature nearest the flail snail.
5-7 Spell functions normally.
8-9 The spell fails.
10 The spell strikes the caster instead.
