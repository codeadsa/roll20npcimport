SPECIAL ABILITIES
Musk (Ex) Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a single target within 10 feet as a standard action. With a successful ranged touch attack, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and then sickened for 1d4 minutes by the horrific stench. A successful save reduces the effect to only 1d4 rounds of being sickened. A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as it is affected by this musk. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.
