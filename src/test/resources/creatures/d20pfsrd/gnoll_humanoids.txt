Editorâ€™s Note The stats given for the gnoll indicate that it has a shield bonus to its AC, as well as listing a heavy wooden shield in the Treasure line. However, the attack line states that it is wielding a spear two-handed in melee. It is completely reasonable that gnolls use a wide variety of weapons, so here are two alternative stat block entries which allow for both situations (wielding a heavy shield or wielding a spear two-handed.) The entries below should replace those given in the original stat block at left (depending on which you choose to use).
Wielding Battleaxe plus Heavy Wooden Shield
AC As shown at left
Melee battleaxe +3 (1d8+2/x3)
Ranged longbow +1 (1d8/x3)
Wielding Spear Two-Handed:
AC 14, touch 10, flat-footed 14 (+3 armor, +1 natural)
Melee As shown at left
Treasure NPC Gear (studded leather armor, spear, other treasure)
