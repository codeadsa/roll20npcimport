SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) The breath weapon of an elemental water dragon is a 50 ft. cone of superheated steam. This breath weapon is effective both on the surface and underwater.
Capsize (Ex) An elemental water dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the boat captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the elemental water dragon’s size, it takes a cumulative –10 penalty on this CMB check.
Drench (Ex) The elemental water dragon’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of non-magical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental’s HD).
Water Mastery (Ex) An elemental water dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foes are touching water. If the opponent or elemental water dragon is touching the ground, the elemental water dragon takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
Transparency (Ex) When submerged, an elemental water dragon is effectively invisible (DC 35 Perception check when near the surface only) until it attacks.
