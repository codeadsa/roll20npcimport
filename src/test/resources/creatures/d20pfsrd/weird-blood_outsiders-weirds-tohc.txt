TACTICS
Blood weirds wait patiently in their pool for potential prey. When a foe wanders close, the weird lashes out and intertwines itself around the opponent. On the next round, it attempts to fall back into its pool, bringing the grabbed opponent with it. Grabbed foes are either drowned or subjected to its siphoning attack.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Pool (Ex) A blood weird’s pool is a bubbling, flowing mass of dark, rich, red blood. Creatures pinned underneath the blood are subject to drowning (see below).
Drench (Ex) The weird’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic cast by a sorcerer whose level equals the weird’s HD total.
Drown (Ex) If a blood weird grapples a foe, it can fully immerses its victim in its blood pool as a free action. A victim completely immersed must hold its breath or drown. See the “Drowning” section in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.
Reform (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a blood weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from firebased spells and effects.
Siphon (Su) A blood weird that hits a foe siphons off a portion of its blood. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each time the blood weird hits. A creature struck can make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save to negate the ability damage that round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures without blood (GM’s discretion) are immune to this effect.
Transparency (Ex) A blood weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks.
