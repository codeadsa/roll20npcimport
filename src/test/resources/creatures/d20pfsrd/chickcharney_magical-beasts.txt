SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blessed Trill (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a melodious trill that grants all creatures within a 20-foot radius a +1 morale bonus on saving throws for the rest of the day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.
Ill Luck (Su) When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its natural attacks, the target is exposed to the chickcharney’s curse.
Curse of Ill Luck: save Will DC 14; effect the creature takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.
A creature can be affected by a curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of –4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Maddening Screech (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius. An affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become confused for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
