SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Tree Command (Su) A great caretaker is never helpless when in a forest. A great caretaker can command any tree and plant creature within 120 feet. An awakened tree or other intelligent plant can attempt a DC 23 Will save to resist this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Any trees commanded by this ability are treated as mindless treants with no Intelligence score and no movement speed.
Dwarven Hatred (Ex) A great caretaker knows how dwarves fight and how best to kill them. A great caretaker gains a +4 dodge bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures with the dwarf subtype. This bonus to Armor Class is lost when a great caretaker is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
Healing Sap (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a great caretaker can cover a wound on a living creature with sap from its body. The sap cures 2d8 points of damage. When a great caretaker uses this ability, it loses its fast healing ability until it can use this ability again. Healing from this ability does not deal damage to undead creatures.
Skilled (Ex) A great caretaker treats Heal and Knowledge (nature) as class skills.
Vulnerable to Axes (Ex) Weapons from the axes weapon group (see the fighter’s weapon training ability in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook) deal 1-1/2 times their normal damage against a great caretaker.
