SPECIAL ABILITIES
Howl (Su) A howler’s constant howling is a grating, exhausting baying that can drive listeners insane. All beings other than outsiders within 120 feet of a howling howler must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or become cursed by the creature’s howl. Once a creature becomes cursed in this way, she takes no additional penalty for being exposed to additional howlers’ howls until the current howler curse is lifted. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Howler Howl: Curse—howl; save Will DC 12 negates; frequency 1/hour; effect 1 Wisdom damage; cure 1 save.
Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a howler’s quill attack or its quill defense, that creature must make a successful DC 14 Reflex save or one quill breaks off in its flesh, causing the target to become sickened until all embedded quills are removed.
Removing one quill requires a DC 15 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a howler with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the howler’s quills and suffers from the howler’s pain attack.
