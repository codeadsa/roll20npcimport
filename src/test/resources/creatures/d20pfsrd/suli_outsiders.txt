TACTICS
Before Combat When traveling alone, suli-jann avoid combat as best they can, unless they are certain they can defeat an opponent. With a larger group, suli-jann hide their otherworldly nature until it becomes necessary to employ their elemental powers for defense.
During Combat A suli-janni does his best to defeat an opponent without revealing his unusual heritage by resorting to elemental abilities. If the battle turns sour, a suli-janni unleashes an elemental assault to try and even the battle.
Morale Suli consider it a point of dishonor to flee a battle that has been honorably engaged, though they would rather flee than die from an ambush or trap. A wounded suli offered an honorable surrender usually accepts.
