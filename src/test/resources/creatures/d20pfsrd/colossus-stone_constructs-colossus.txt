SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alternate Form (Ex) A stone colossus can take the form of a small keep as a full-round action. Its DR increases to 20/epic, and it gains fast healing 10. While in this form, the colossus cannot make melee attacks.
Movable Keep (Ex) In either form, a stone colossus holds up to 12 Medium creatures. Those on its ramparts gain cover. Any inside when it’s destroyed take 3d10+20 points of damage.
Selective Antimagic Aura (Su) Spells with the earth or force descriptor or that transmute or manipulate earth or stone are unaffected by this field.
Self Repair (Ex) A stone colossus can expend one use of Mythic Power as a swift action to gain fast healing 20 for 5 rounds.
Siege Tower (Ex) A stone colossus’s ballistae don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, and they reload themselves at the start of the colossus’s turn.
