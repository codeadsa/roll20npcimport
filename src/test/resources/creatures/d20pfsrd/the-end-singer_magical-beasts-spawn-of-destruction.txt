SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Rage (Ex) Any creature taking bleed damage from its razor tongues takes a –4 penalty on Will saves and is affected as the murderous command spell (Will DC 16 negates) each round that bleeding continues, ignoring allies that are also taking bleed damage from it.
Eye Rays (Su) The End-Singer fires eye rays at a range of up to 120 feet. Creatures struck by his eye rays are nauseated for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 29 negates). In addition, if the target fails a second Fortitude save against the same DC, it gains one of the following conditions, lasting as long as the nauseated condition, as its mind and body begin to unravel (roll 1d6):
d6 Condition
1 Confused
2 Fatigued (exhausted if already fatigued)
3 Shaken (increase severity of fear effect if already present)
4 Sickened
5 Staggered
6 Stunned
Reroll if an identical condition already exists. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shatter Silence (Su) The End-Singer’s presence unravels magical silence effects or effects that provide energy resistance against sonic attacks. At the beginning of its turn, any such effect within 60 feet is targeted as dispel magic (caster level 25th).
