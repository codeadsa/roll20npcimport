SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) A blood orchid sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check with two or more tentacles against a single foe a blood orchid can pull the grappled creature to the mouth on its underside as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
The mouth latches on and drains blood from the victim.
Each round it maintains its grapple, the blood orchid automatically deals 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim’s blood.
Poison (Ex) Tentacle—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect unconsciousness; cure 1 save.
Telepathic Bond (Ex) Blood orchids communicate through a non-magical telepathic bond. They can sense emotions in other blood orchids at a distance of 100 ft. or less, and emotions in other creatures at a range of five feet. They can communicate mentally with each other through full telepathy at a distance of 20 ft. or less, and can share knowledge very rapidly when touching each other.
