SPECIAL ABILITIES
Paralysis (Ex) Any creature that is hit by a slithering tracker’s slam attack comes into contact with the anesthetizing slime it secretes. The opponent must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be paralyzed—at the end of each round thereafter, the paralyzed victim can attempt a new Fortitude save to recover from this paralysis. When a victim recovers from a slithering tracker’s paralysis, the victim is staggered for 1d6 rounds. This DC is Constitution-based.
Transparent (Ex) Because of its lack of coloration, a slithering tracker is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. The slithering tracker gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks as a result, and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. A creature that fails to notice a slithering tracker and walks into it automatically takes damage as if struck by the slithering tracker’s slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt and paralysis by the ooze.
