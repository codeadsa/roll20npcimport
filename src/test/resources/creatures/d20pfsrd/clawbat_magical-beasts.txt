SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Scent (Ex) A clawbat can detect any creature at less than maximum hit points as if it had scent. Those at full hit points cannot be detected by the blood scent ability.
Distraction (Ex) A clawbat’s lengthy tongue whips around its body as it feeds, lapping up the blood from wounded creatures nearby. Every round a clawbat may choose either a creature it attacks or any creature it passes adjacent to as it moves. If the target is at less than full hit points, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
