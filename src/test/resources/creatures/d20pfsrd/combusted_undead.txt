SPECIAL ABILITIES
Combustion (Su) Curse—slam; save Fort DC 13; onset immediate; frequency 1/round; effect 2d6 fire damage that ignores fire resistance; cure 1 save. A creature that falls below 0 hit points from this curse spontaneously combusts, dying instantly. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Fire Blast (Sp) This ability has a 30 foot range and can be used at will as a standard action.
Howl of Agony (Ex) A combusted perpetually screams in agony, forcing each creature within 10 feet to succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be stunned with fear for 1d4 rounds. A creature cannot be affected by the same combusted’s howl of agony ability more than once every 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Susceptible to Water (Ex) A vial of water can be used as a splash weapon against a combusted, dealing 1d4 points of damage on a hit or 1 point of damage on a splash. Holy water deals double damage to a combusted. Rainfall deals 1d6 points of damage per round to a combusted, and full immersion in water deals 6d6 points of damage per round.
Despite this, the supernatural fires that burn in a combusted cannot be extinguished by mere water, and a combusted cannot be reduced to fewer hit points than it has Hit Dice (5 hp for most combusted) by water alone.
