TACTICS
Before Combat Bugbears slink in shadow and behind closed doors. They revel in the look of terror on a foeâ€™s face when they suddenly loom from the darkness, often with some horrible trophy in hand.
During Combat Bugbears do not enjoy protracted fighting and seek to down a foe and slip away as quickly and quietly as possible. They favor hit-and-run tactics when the situation allows, striking at the most vulnerable point or member of a group.
Morale A bugbear is not foolish enough to fight to the death, as that would preclude it from menacing others at a later date. It usually flees if reduced to 5 hit points.
