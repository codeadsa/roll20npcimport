TACTICS
A blood wight enters combat slashing with its claws. Given a chance, it grabs the closest opponent and engulfs it, holding it inside its body until it drowns. Drowned foes are ejected from the blood wight’s body into a heap on the ground (the blood wight later devours any creature it kills).

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) A blood wight can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The blood wight attempts a grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and claws its opponent with a +4 bonus on the attack roll.
Attacks that hit an engulfing blood wight deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. An engulfed victim must hold its breath as long as it remains trapped or begin to drown. A trapped victim can break free with a successful grapple check.
A Large blood wight’s body can engulf 1 Medium, 2 Small, 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 32 Fine or smaller opponents.
