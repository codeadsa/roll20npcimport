SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attach (Ex) When a volt hits with bite, it latches onto the opponent’s body, anchoring it in place. An attached volt is effectively grappling its prey. The volt loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target’s flesh. A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached volt can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself–if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the volt is removed.
Shock (Su) A volt delivers an electrical charge when it hits with its tail slap, dealing 2d4 points of nonlethal damage. An attached volt can attack the grappled opponent with its tail slap with a +4 bonus in the same round.
