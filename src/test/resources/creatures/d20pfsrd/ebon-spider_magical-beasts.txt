TACTICS
Ebon spiders are prone to charge into combat, trying to kill as many creatures as possible. Being intelligent, they prefer to attack spellcasters over armored opponents, using their Mobility and Spring Attack feats to keep their opponents off-balance.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Nightmare (Su) A creature that fails the secondary saving throw against an ebon spider’s poison is subject to its nightmare effect. Once each year on the anniversary of the spider’s attack, the creature lapses into a comatose state for 24 hours that is marked by sweating, uncontrollable shaking, and vivid dreams that recreate the attack in the mind of the victim. In addition, each time the creature finds itself in the domain of an ebon spider (marked by the massive webs of its dream), the creature suffers a -4 morale penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws. This mind-affecting fear effect can be removed by the remove curse spell or DC 25 break enchantment spell cast within a number of days of the attack equal to the caster’s level. Afterwards, only a miracle or wish spell is sufficient to remove the effect.
Poison (Ex) Nightmare Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 21, frequency 1/round for 2 rounds, effect 1d3 Str damage plus nightmare (see above), cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Profane Infusion (Su) An ebon spider is infused with profane energy, granting it a +4 profane bonus on its AC and saving throws.
