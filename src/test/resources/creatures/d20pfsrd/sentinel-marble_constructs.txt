SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alert (Su) A marble sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it’s keyed. When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it’s keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn’t affect normal concentration. A marble sentinel’s creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A marble sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the force descriptor.
Paralyzing Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of energy as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
