SPECIAL ABILITIES
Confusion Aura (Su) A group of three or more huggermuggers can, as a free action, create an aura of confusion. Anyone within 40 feet of the huggermuggers must succeed at a Will save (DC 12, +1 per huggermugger in the group) or be affected as by a confusion spell for 5 rounds. All huggermuggers in the group must be within 30 feet of each other to create this aura. Each huggermugger may contribute to the confusion aura once per day. A creature that makes a successful save cannot be affected by the confusion aura of any huggermuggers in that group for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Natural Cunning (Ex) Huggermuggers possess innate cunning and logical ability. This makes them immune to maze spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.
