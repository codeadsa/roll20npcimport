SPECIAL ABILITIES
Missing Dimension (Ex) A thin man only exists in two dimensions, allowing him to deliver vicious attacks with his arm blades, as well as providing a measure of defense against those who have trouble perceiving him. A creature must make a DC 22 Perception check when attacking a thin man. Success means the thin man only has concealment against the attack, while failure means the creature has total concealment. The DC for the Perception check is Dexterity-based.
A thin man within 30 feet of another of his kind must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
