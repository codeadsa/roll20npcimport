SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eye Rays (Su) A retriever’s eyes can produce four different magical rays, each with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks—firing an eye ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC for eye rays is 19—the save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. The eye ray effects are the following.
Fire: Deals 12d6 fire damage (Reflex half). Cold: Deals 12d6 cold damage (Reflex half). Electricity: Deals 12d6 electricity damage (Reflex half). Petrification: Target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone permanently. Relentless (Su) A retriever is constantly under the effects of spider climb and water walk; these abilities cannot be dispelled.
