SPECIAL ABILITIES
Elemental Vulnerability (Ex) Lava children take 1 extra point of damage per caster level from spells and effects with the air or water subtype and from spells of the Air and Water domains.
Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) Lava children are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain.
Immunity to Metal (Ex) Lava children are completely immune to any metal object or weapon and its effects (swords, armor, doors, walls, for example). Metal simply passes through the lava child as though it did not exist. Metal items are not destroyed, just ignored. Any metal weapon (including magic weapons) that strikes a lava child deals no damage and simply passes through its body. Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as though they did not exist.
All attacks against a metal-armored foe are considered melee touch attacks as the lava childâ€™s attacks simply pass through the metal armor.
