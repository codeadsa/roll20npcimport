TACTICS
Lilith begins combat by peppering her foes with her spell-like abilities. When combat begins, Lilith usually hits the closest opponents (she deems most susceptible) with her mass hold monster ability. Next she unleashes a fireball hoping to engulf as many opponents as possible. She then charges in with her longsword, peppering her foes with lightning bolt and fireballs. If she has time before battle begins, she uses her magic circle against good and her unholy aura on herself. Any foes slain in combat are subjected to her animate dead spell-like ability. Against powerful foes she summons other devils to fight with her.

“…and thus, Lucifer created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, Malefacta, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again.” —translated from the ‘Infernal Grimoire: The Politics of Hell’
