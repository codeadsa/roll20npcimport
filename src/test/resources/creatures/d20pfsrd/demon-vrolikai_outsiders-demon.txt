SPECIAL ABILITIES
Black Flame Knives (Su) A vrolikai can manifest daggers made of crystallized black flames in each of its four hands as a free action. These weapons function as +1 daggers that bestow one permanent negative level on a successful hit. A DC 27 Fortitude negates the negative level, although on a critical hit, no save is allowed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Death-Stealing Gaze (Su) 1 permanent negative level, 30 ft., Fort DC 27 negates. Creatures slain by these negative levels become juju zombies under the vrolikai’s control. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a gaze attack.
Madness (Su) A creature stung by a vrolikai’s tail must make a DC 27 Will save to resist taking 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becoming confused for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the victim is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds as strange visions assault its mind. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A vrolikai never takes penalties on its attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.
