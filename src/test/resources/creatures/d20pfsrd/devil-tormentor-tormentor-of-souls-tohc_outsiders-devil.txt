SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ghost Touch (Ex) A tormentor devil deals damage normally with its claws against incorporeal creatures.
Soul Track (Su) A tormentor devil can track the soul of any creature that enters any of the planes of Hell. Tracking a soul has a base DC of 20 and follows the rules for tracking. A tormentor devil must be on the same plane as the soul it is tracking.
Soulcatcher Net A tormentor devil’s net looks like a normal net and follows the rules for net attacks. The net has 20 hit points; the Escape Artist check to get free is DC 30; the net can be broken with a successful DC 30 Strength check. The net can entrap incorporeal creatures.
The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it. These barbs deal 1d6 points of damage each round to any creature caught in the net, including incorporeal creatures. (The incorporeal creature’s 50% chance to avoid damage from a corporeal source does not apply to this attack.)
