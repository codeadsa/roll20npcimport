SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Ex) A Jubilex-touched marsh jelly deals 3d6 points of acid damage and 3d6 points of profane damage to anything within 10 feet when it is killed. A successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half (but does not reduce the profane damage).
Disorienting Glow (Ex) When a marsh jelly first takes damage, its body begins pulsating and flashing rapidly, emitting an eerie greenish glow. Creatures viewing a pulsating marsh jelly must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Tentacle–injury; save DC 22; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
