SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Each type of mephit can unleash a particular breath weapon every 4 rounds as a standard action. The DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
The breath weapon of a dust mephit is a cone of dust that deals 1d4 slashing damage. The dust also causes living creatures to be sickened for 3 rounds. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect.
