SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eel Dart (Ex) A galvo can launch one of its component eels like a dart up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An eel dart deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + the galvo’s Strength modifier plus 1d6 points of electricity damage.
Swarmlike (Ex) A galvo has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature function normally against a galvo, since the creature’s individual components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons.
Varied Attack (Ex) A galvo’s slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the creature is formed completely of biting eels.
