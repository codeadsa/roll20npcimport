TACTICS
Giant electric catfish are territorial and defend their realms with great ferocity. Before engaging in combat, when threatened or facing a potential enemy, an electric catfish generates a pulse of crackling electricity in an effort to intimidate or discourage would-be predators. Failing this, the giant electric catfish enters combat and bites its foe. A giant electric catfish produces an electrical charge that tends to stun any creature within ten feet of it. Stunned prey are bitten and swallowed.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electricity Discharge (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a giant electric catfish can generate a pulse of electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to everything a 10 ft. radius. Living creatures within the area not only take damage but also are stunned for one round. A successful DC 20 Reflex save reduces the electricity damage by half and negates the stunning effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
