SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deceptive (Ex) A mi-go is a master of deception. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for a mi-go.
Evisceration (Ex) A mi-go’s claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or those it has grappled. When a mi-go makes a successful grapple check, in addition to any other effects caused by a successful grapple, it deals sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Item Creation (Ex) A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources—this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.
Starflight (Su) A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM’s discretion)—provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.
