TACTICS
When given instructions to track and kill their target, a pack of elusa hounds uses tactics similar to other canine animals: circle the prey and attack simultaneously from the front, rear, and flanks. These beasts can easily be trained to pin or hold a foe rather than kill it. This tactic is often employed by military or government units when they wish to capture and interrogate a renegade spellcaster. When using these tactics, the elusa hound attempts to trip its foe and then pins it with a bite.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Arcane Sight (Su) Elusa hounds can detect magical auras in a 120-foot radius, as per the arcane sight spell cast by a sorcerer at 6th level. This ability can be dispelled, but the elusa hound can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Using this ability, the elusa hound can instantly identify any spellcaster within range.
Aura Tracking (Su) If an elusa hound has “tasted” the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has successfully used its arcane sight ability against or a spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its Survival check when tracking that target. The aura must be fresh (“tasted” within the last 3 hours) or the elusa hound does not gain this bonus.
