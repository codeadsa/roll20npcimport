SPECIAL ABILITIES
Desert Thirst (Su) A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 26). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 30) or be destroyed.
Electricity Aura (Su) A wyrm blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn.
Mirage (Su) A wyrm blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 26 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.
Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener’s Sense Motive check.
Storm Breath (Su) A wyrm blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is 22d8. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is 30. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds.
