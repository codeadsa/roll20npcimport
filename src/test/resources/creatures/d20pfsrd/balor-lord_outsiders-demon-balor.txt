TACTICS
A balor lord relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee—with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor lord can use the latter tactic and still inflict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor lord reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks slay a neighboring creature, an ally if neccesary, in order to activate its life drinker supernatural ability, otherwise it will flee via teleportation, if both these tactics prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rage (Ex) This balor lord can rage for 27 rounds per day, and gains +4 to Strength and Constitution, and -2 to AC
Knockback (Ex): Once per round, the balor lord can make a bull rush attempt against one target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage equal to the lords’s Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The balor lord does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Scent (Ex): The balor lord gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes.
Death Throes (Su) When killed, a balor lord explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet. A Reflex save DC 35 halve the damage, this DC increases to 37 if the balor lord was killed in rage as the save DC is Constitution-based.
Entangle (Ex) If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not.
Flaming Body (Su) A balor lord’s body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.
Lifedrinker (Su) Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round.
Vorpal Strike (Su) Any slashing weapon a balor lord wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any.
Whip Mastery (Ex) A balor lord treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe’s armor.
