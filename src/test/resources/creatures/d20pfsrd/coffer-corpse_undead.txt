SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Grip (Ex) Because the coffer corpse grasps the victim’s throat, a creature in its death grip cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
Deceiving Death (Ex) In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of damage (whether the damage bypasses the creature’s damage reduction or not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 competence bonus on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.
Fear (Su) A creature viewing a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving death ability must make a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
