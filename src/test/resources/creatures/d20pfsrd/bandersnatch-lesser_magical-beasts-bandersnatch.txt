SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bounding Charge (Ex) A lesser bandersnatch can move through difficult terrain when it charges.
Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a lesser bandersnatch’s tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap. A lesser bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on attack rolls when using its tail slap.
Gaze (Su) Confused, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 23 negates. A lesser bandersnatch can direct its gaze attack against a single foe as a swift action. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a lesser bandersnatch can make a single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A lesser bandersnatch cannot lash out on the same round it charges.
Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a lesser bandersnatch’s tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that creature must make a DC 24 Reflex save or a quill lodges in its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d8+4* points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Planar Acclimation (Ex) A lesser bandersnatch is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a lesser bandersnatch with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d8+4* points of piercing damage from the lesser bandersnatch’s quills and suffers from the lesser bandersnatch’s pain attack.
Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a lesser bandersnatch can loose a volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during which the lesser bandersnatch’s defensive abilities are unaffected.
Relentless Tracker (Ex) A lesser bandersnatch can move at up to double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track creatures it has wounded.
