SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drain Memory (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can make a touch attack with either its hands or one of its eye probes to drain a target of its memories. The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and identity, and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject to a charm monster spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28 negates). The hyakume absorbs the memories and can store and use them. It can store the memories of a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Eye Probe (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to six of its eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through all of its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a hyakume’s eyeball is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An eye probe can’t stray farther than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage).
Monk Abilities The hyakume’s Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though it were a 15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once per day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Transfer Memories (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a willing creature with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories it has stored to the creature touched. This is a mind-affecting effect.
