SPECIAL ABILITIES
Festering Heads (Su) Once the heads in a shenzuzhou’s collection rot out naturally, it can hurl them as a thrown splash weapon (range increment 30 ft.) as a standard action. A thrown head ruptures on impact, releasing noxious gas that produces an effect identical to a stinking cloud spell (DC 22). The save is Charisma-based.
A typical shenzuzhou carries 1d4 festering heads. The heads do not rupture if thrown by another creature.
