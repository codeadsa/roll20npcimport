SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dazzling Burst (Su) Once per day, a d’ziriak can cause its body to flare with intense, colorful light as a swift action. Non-d’ziriaks within a 20-foot radius must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. After using this ability, the d’ziriak’s brilliant glow is extinguished for 24 hours. This ability is a light effect, and creatures that cannot see are immune to it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Glow (Ex) The colorful runes that decorate a d’ziriak’s body create dim light in a 20-foot radius from its body.
