SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Su) While ash giants are immune to disease, they carry a contagious form of leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash giant’s attacks is exposed to this virulent sickness.
Ash Leprosy: Injury; save Fort 23; onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Oversized Weapon (Ex) An ash giant can wield Huge weapons without penalty.
Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid’s wild empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash giant gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash giant to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats).
