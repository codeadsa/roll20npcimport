SPECIAL ABILITIES
Claws (Ex) A crypt thing’s claws are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Teleport Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location. An affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination.
A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).
