SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shears (Su) An immature norn’s shears function as a +5 keen scimitar when she wields them, instead of as a +5 mithral keen speed scimitar like the shears wielded by fully grown norns.
Sister Seeking (Su) An immature norn separated from her sisters has an innate ability to locate them across any distance on the same plane. The norn can sense when she is facing in the direction of one or both of her sisters, as well as in which direction they are moving. This sense does not grant a norn the ability to assess distance to her sisters. Once the norn rejoins one or both of her sisters, she loses this ability.
