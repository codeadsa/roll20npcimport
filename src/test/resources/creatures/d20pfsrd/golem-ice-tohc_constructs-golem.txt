Cold (Ex) An ice golem’s body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of damage with its touch. Creatures attacking an ice golem unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hit.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An ice golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.
Lightning-based effects slow an ice golem (as the spell) for 2d6 rounds. Cold-based effects heal all of its lost hit points.
Construction ICE GOLEM
An ice golem’s body must be constructed from a single block of ice weighing at least 1,000 pounds. The ice is treated with magical powders and unguents worth at least 500 gp.
