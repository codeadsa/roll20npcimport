SPECIAL ABILITIES
Absorb Body (Su) A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 or less hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least one full round. An unconscious or dying opponent can make a DC 25 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption. A dead opponent gets no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered.
All-Around Vision (Ex) The corpse orgy sees in all directions at once. It can not be flanked.
Pain Shriek (Su) Twice per day, as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing shriek from the various heads captured in its form. This shriek deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within a 40-foot radius around the corpse orgy. Affected creatures can make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures that cannot hear do not take this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
