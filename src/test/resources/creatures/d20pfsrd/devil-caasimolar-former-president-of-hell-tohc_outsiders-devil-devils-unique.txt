TACTICS
When first engaged in battle, Caasimolar uses his fear effect against all within range that can hear him. When encountered with his personal retinue of devils, he prefers to let them fight, while he hangs back and peppers the enemy with slay living effects (from his rod) or cones of cold.
If his enemies force him into battle, he begins by releasing a slay living effect against who he deems to be the most powerful foe in the group. If this fails, he quickly unleashes a lightning bolt from his rod at the same target. If forced to fight close quarter, he relies on his rod’s physical power as well as its spell-like effects, and he utilizes his spell-like abilities. If the day is lost, Caasimolar summons devils to cover his escape before teleporting away to safety.
