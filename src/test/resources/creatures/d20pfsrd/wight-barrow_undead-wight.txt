SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a barrow wight becomes a barrow wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical barrow wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the barrow wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and freewilled barrow wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Insanity Gaze (Su) Anyone with 30 feet that meets a barrow wight’s gaze is affected as if by an insanity spell. A successful DC 14 Will save negates the effect and renders the target immune to the same barrow wight’s insanity gaze for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead spell cast on a barrow wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
