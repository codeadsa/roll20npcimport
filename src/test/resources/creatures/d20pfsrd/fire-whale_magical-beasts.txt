SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hold Breath (Ex) A fire whale can hold its breath for 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Scalding Blast (Su) As a full round action, a fire whale can release a blast of superheated air from its blowhole that scalds or burns those contacting it. The cone-shaped blast has a range of 60 ft and deals 12d6 points of damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using its scalding blast again. After using this ability four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least two full rounds before it can use it again.
