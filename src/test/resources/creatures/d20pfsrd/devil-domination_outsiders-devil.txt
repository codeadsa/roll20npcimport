SPECIAL ABILITIES
Flail Master (Ex) Gladiatrixes undergo a grueling training regimen with dire flails. A gladiatrixâ€™s skill is such that the penalties for two-weapon fighting are further reduced by 2 and she receives a +4 competence bonus on damage rolls. Both of these benefits apply only when using flails.
Manic Charge (Ex) A gladiatrix can charge up to triple her normal speed (up to 120 ft.) instead of double as normally allowed. Furthermore, she can make up to two turns of no more than 90 degrees while charging.
Team Fighting (Ex) When two gladiatrixes flank an opponent, they each receive a +4 flanking bonus to attack rolls instead of the normal +2.
