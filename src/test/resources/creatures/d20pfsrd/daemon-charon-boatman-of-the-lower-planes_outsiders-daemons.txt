SPECIAL ABILITIES
Paralysis (Ex) A creature hit by Charon’s staff takes normal damage and must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 minutes. The paralysis ability only functions in Charon’s hands.
Control Styx (Su) Charon can control the waters of the River Styx as if using the control water spell (CL 23rd). Additionally, he can form a Huge 16 HD water elemental (known as a Styx elemental) as a standard action using this ability. A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the following additional special attack:
An opponent hit by a Styx elemental’s slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic. Charon can have only one Styx elemental in existence at one time. A Styx elemental is CR 8.
Immortality (Ex) Charon is native to five Lower Planes (Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells, and Tarterus), thus when his form is destroyed on one plane, he ceases to exist there, but still exists on the other four. When destroyed on one of the aforementioned planes, it takes but a single day for him to reform and return to that plane. To be permanently destroyed, Charon must be slain on all five Lower Planes within a single day.
