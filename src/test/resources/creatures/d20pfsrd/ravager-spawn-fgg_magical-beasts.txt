Variants
Ravager SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Resistance (Ex) A Ravager spawn possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill or permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment. Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required saving throws.
Energy Resistance (Ex) A Ravager spawn possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic).
Form-Shifting (Ex) A Ravager spawn can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the three listed forms: the Crawler, the Brawler, or the Flier. Doing so takes one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions, though it is not considered helpless.
Magic Disruption (Su) Every time a Ravager spawn comes into contact with a spell or spell-like or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is made each round.
Regeneration (Ex) A Ravager spawn treats all damage as subdual, except damage from epic-level weapons and artifacts.
Vampiric Healing (Su) Whenever a Ravager spawn hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its trample special attack, where applicable.
