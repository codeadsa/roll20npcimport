TACTICS
During Combat The Mouse Lord enters combat using her bite. Most often she enters battle with greater magic fang already affecting her. When enough foes are within range, she unleashes her confusion ability and usually displaces on her next turn. If combat goes against her, she summons other rodents to aid her or to cover her escape.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) The Mouse Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Mouse Lord cannot use her natural weapons or disease special attack but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Mouse Lord retains her movement modes (and speeds) in human form.
Disease (Ex) Black fever—bite, save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; damage 1d4 Dex, 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. The Mouse Lord can suppress her ability to cause disease (as a free action) if she so wishes.
Immortality (Su) The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Mouse Lord’s soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week, it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit).
Keen Senses (Ex) The Mouse Lord sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.
Rodent Passivism (Ex) Rodents (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Mouse Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Mouse Lord attacks a rodent, its protection against that creature ends.
