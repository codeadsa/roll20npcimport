SPECIAL ABILITIES
Infectious Laughter (Su) As a full-round action, a harionago can emit a scornful laugh ringing out in a 60-foot burst. A creature that hears the laughter must succeed at a DC 23 Will saving thrown or be affected as the hideous laughter spell (CL 14th), except that a laughing creature is considered helpless to the harionago. A creature that successfully saves against a harionago’s scornful laughter can’t be affected by that same harionago’s laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect that can be countered with the countersong class feature. Its save DC is Charisma-based. Despite her ragged dress and unkempt appearance, a harionago is a beautiful and graceful creature. She walks the roads at night pretending to be a lost damsel, luring those she encounters close before striking with her paralyzing claws and jagged hair barbs. However, a harionago’s most dangerous weapon is her laugh. A resounding cackle of mocking scorn and hateful malice, it compels those around her to join in mocking concert.
