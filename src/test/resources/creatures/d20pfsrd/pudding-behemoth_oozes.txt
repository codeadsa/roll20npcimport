SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A behemoth pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers damage from a behemoth pudding’s acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a behemoth pudding takes 2d8 acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 25 Reflex save. If a behemoth pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 25 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a behemoth pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a behemoth pudding. Instead, the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
Suction (Ex) The behemoth pudding can create powerful suction against any surface as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A behemoth pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a behemoth pudding’s CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.
