SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A brontosaurus can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the boat captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the brontosaurus’s size, it takes a cumulative –10 penalty on this CMB check.
