SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devouring grapple (Ex) The mouth at the center of a baregara’s chest automatically deals 2d8+4 points of damage per round to any creature the baregara successfully grapples.
Monstrous Challenge (Su) As a standard action, a baregara can make an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful, the baregara surges with power and gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for 10 minutes. This ability is usable three times per day.
One-Armed Hold (Ex) A baregara’s huge arms allow it to initiate and maintain a grapple without the standard -4 penalty for not having both hands free.
Editor’s Note
The Melee attack line appears to be incorrect (primary attack deals +1/2 Str damage, and secondary deals +full). The suggested corrected line appears below.
Melee bite +23 (1d8+8), 2 claws +23 (1d10+8 plus grab), gore +18 (1d8+4)
