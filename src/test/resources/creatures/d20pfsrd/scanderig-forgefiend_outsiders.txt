SPECIAL ABILITIES
Adamantine Bite (Ex) A forgefiend’s bite attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Rend Armor (Ex) When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the target—this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is Strength-based.
Searing Spew (Su) A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The slag quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen metal that is treated as difficult terrain—this stuff crumbles to powder in 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.
