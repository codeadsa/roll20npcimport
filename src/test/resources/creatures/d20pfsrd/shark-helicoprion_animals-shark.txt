SPECIAL ABILITIES
Whorled Jaw (Ex) When a helicoprion hits a Medium or smaller creature with its bite it can, as a free action, attempt to grapple and then pin that creature should the initial grapple be successful. Once the target is pinned, the helicoprion continues to do its bite damage (including bleed) for as long as it maintains the pin.
