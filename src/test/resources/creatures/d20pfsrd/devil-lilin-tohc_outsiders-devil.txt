TACTICS
A lilin always enters combat with her protection from good in effect and begins by attempting to charm the closest foe. A weak-minded foe that comes within range is subjected to a suggestion. Afterwards she usually attacks with her longsword. If combat goes poorly for a lilin she attempts to flee but not before summoning a host of devils to cover her escape.
