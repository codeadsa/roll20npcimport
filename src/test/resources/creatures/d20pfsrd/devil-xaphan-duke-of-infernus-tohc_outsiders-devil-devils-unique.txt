TACTICS
Xaphan is a deadly adversary in battle and rarely, if ever, backs down from a fight. He is not stupid however, and should the battle go against him, he either flees (via greater teleport) or summons a troupe of pit fiends to cover his escape. In battle, Xaphan unleashes his full fury against a foe; starting with his fiery gaze. Those that survive are then witness to his fiery aura power. If within range, he likes to grab a foe and hold on while using his fiery aura power. The rest of the battle alternates between Xaphan using his great falchion and his spells and spell-like abilities.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fiery Aura (Su) As a free action, Xaphan can cause his entire body to erupt in unholy fire (the same fires he uses to stoke his furnaces). Creatures within 5 feet of or grappling Xaphan take 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage each round. There is no save against either effect, but resistance to or immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage.
Fiery Gaze (Su) A creature that meets Xaphan’s gaze must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows:
1st-round: The victim’s blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim’s blood reaches searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance penalty increases to –4. Smoke rises from the victim’s flesh. The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 3rd-round: The victim’s blood erupts into an inferno and explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but the victim is still stunned. A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan’s gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based and the Fortitude saves are Constitution-based. GEAR Unique Item: Hellstorm
Xaphan’s unique weapon, Hellstorm, is a Large +4 unholy flaming burst falchion.
