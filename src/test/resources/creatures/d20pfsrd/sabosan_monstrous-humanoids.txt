SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dust Cloud (Ex) A sabosan gains Hover as a bonus feat, and can use this feat to create a dust cloud even though it is not Large. The resulting dust cloud has only a 30-foot radius.
Fell Shriek (Su) As a standard action, a sabosan can emit a deafening cry in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. Sabosan are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
