SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A whip jelly secretes a deadly acid that quickly dissolves organic matter but does not harm metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Non-metal armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a whip jelly dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
