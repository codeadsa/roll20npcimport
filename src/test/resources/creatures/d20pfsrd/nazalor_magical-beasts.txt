SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rage (Ex) Three times per day, a nazalor can whip itself into a maddening frenzy. As long as it rages it gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and -2 AC. This rage lasts up to 1 minute, but the nazalor can end it early if desired. It is not fatigued when its rage ends.
While raging, a nazalor has the following changes made to the statistics block above: AC 16 (+3 Dex, +5 natural, -2 rage), touch 11, flat-footed 13; hp 92; Atk 2 claws +15 (1d8+7) and bite +15 (1d8+7); Fort +12; Str 25; Con 22.
Stun (Ex) If a nazalor hits an opponent with both claws and its bite in the same round, that opponent must succeed on a DC 18 (DC 20 when raging) Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
