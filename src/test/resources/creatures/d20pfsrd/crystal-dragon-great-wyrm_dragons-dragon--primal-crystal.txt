SPECIAL ABILITIES
Razor Sharp (Sp) All of a crystal dragon’s natural attacks deal slashing damage.
Ray Reflection (Ex) An ancient crystal dragon’s scales reflect ray spells back upon the ray’s source if the ray fails to overcome the dragon’s spell resistance.
Scintillating Aura (Su) A great wyrm crystal dragon radiates an aura of scintillating color from its jeweled scales to a radius of 60 feet. All within this area must make a Will save each round to avoid being stunned (if the victim has 15 or fewer Hit Dice) or confused (if the victim has more than 15 Hit Dice) for 1 round. The save DC is equal to the dragon’s breath weapon save DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.
