SPECIAL ABILITIES
Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a cythnigot’s horrific appearance become sickened for 1 round—a cythnigot’s horrific appearance only functions to a range of 10 feet. Once a creature makes a saving throw against a particular cythnigot’s horrific appearance, that creature is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots for 24 hours. A spellcaster that has a cythnigot as a familiar is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots, and also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against any qlippoth’s horrific appearance.
Spores (Su) Any creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become infested by the creature’s otherworldly spores. These spores cause twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hair-like fibers to erupt from the bite wound and to writhe and wrap around the target’s limbs. A creature suffering from these spores is entangled, and can attempt a new DC 11 Fortitude save in later rounds as a standard action to rip the tendrils free and escape the entangled condition. The effects of multiple cythnigot bites on a creature do not stack. Plant creatures take a –4 penalty on saves against this effect. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
