TACTICS
A Stygian turtle-shark normally begins combat using its Power Attack feat. If it grabs an opponent in its mouth it is just as likely to swallow it as it is to dive as deep in the water as it can in an effort to drown its prey.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark’s size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Shell (Ex) If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.
Smite Good (Su) Once per day, the creature may smite a good-aligned creature. As a swift action, the creature chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the creature adds its Charisma bonus (if any) to attack rolls and gains a damage bonus equal to its HD against that foe. This effect persists until the target is dead or the creature rests.
