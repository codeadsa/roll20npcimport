SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mercury Poisoning (Ex) Slam—injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1 Dexterity damage and 1 Constitution damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
If an opponent failed a save against the poison, one week after suffering the effects of the mercury poisoning, if the target has not received the benefits of a neutralize poison during that time span, then he must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 10th). The effects can be removed by the successful casting of a greater restoration, heal, miracle, or wish spell.
