SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acidic Hide (Ex) Tsathogga’s demonic form constantly oozes and drips acid. Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga’s acidic body likewise takes acid damage.
Blasphemous Croak (Su) Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a blasphemy spell (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects.
Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies non-magical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area.
Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area.
This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.
