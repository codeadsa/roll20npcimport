SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su)
A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.
Cloudwalking (Su) A very young or older silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.
Cold Aura (Su) An old or older silver dragon is surrounded by an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. An ancient dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm’s aura damage increases to 2d6. A silver dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.
Fog Vision (Ex) A juvenile or older silver dragon can see perfectly well in fog and clouds.
Graceful Flight (Ex) A young or older silver dragon’s aerial maneuverability is one step better than normal.
Paralyzing Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of cold, a silver dragon can breathe a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.
