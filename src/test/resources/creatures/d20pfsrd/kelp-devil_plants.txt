SPECIAL ABILITIES
Charm touch (Su) Twice per day, on a successful hit with a frond, a kelp devil can affect the opponent as by charm monster (caster level 12th). The creature can make a DC 18 save DC to resist the effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Underwater Concealment (Ex) The main body of a kelp devil remains submerged even when attacking. This grants it concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks.
