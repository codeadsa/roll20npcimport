SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) An emerald ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal quickly, but does not affect stone or plant matter. Each time a creature suffers damage from an emerald ooze’s acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 16 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal weapon that strikes an emerald ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. If an emerald ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 14 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by an emerald ooze suffers a –4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
Editor’s Note
We noted a couple of errors with this creature:
HP are calculated incorrectly: it should be 4d8+12 for a total of 30. Fort and Reflex saves are too high by 1: it should be Fort +3; Ref +2. GM’s are encouraged to use these statistics.
GMs should also note that the Emerald Ooze does a non-standard amount of damage with its constrict special attack.
