SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Drain (Ex) A gutslug that grapples a foe drains blood. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the grapple is maintained. Once a gutslug has drained 8 points, it detaches and flies or slithers away to digest its meal.
Vulnerabilities (Ex) Gutslugs are vulnerable to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4 points of damage to a gutslug for 1d2 rounds and causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks. A pint of alcohol poured or thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks.
