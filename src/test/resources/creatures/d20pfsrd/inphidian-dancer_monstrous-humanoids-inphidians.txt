Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Entrancing Dance (Su) A dancer inphidian can sway its body in a rhythmic motion that charms all those within 30 feet viewing the dance. The charmer makes a Perform (dance) check. Those viewing the dance must make a successful Will save (DC equal to the charmer’s Perform check) or be fascinated for 1d4+2 rounds. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the entrancing dance of that charmer for one day.
