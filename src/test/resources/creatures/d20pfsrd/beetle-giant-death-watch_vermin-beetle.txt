SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Rattle (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a death watch beetle can vibrate its carapace to produce a clicking noise that sets up vibrations in all creatures within 30 feet. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save take 3d6 damage. Since the effect stems from the vibrations set up in a victim’s body and not from the clicking noise itself, silence offers no protection against this attack. Likewise, a creature that cannot hear can still be affected. A successful save renders the target immune to that death watch beetle’s death rattle for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immunity to Death Effects (Ex) Death watch beetles are immune to any effect that instantly slays it, such as finger of death, slay living, and so on.
