SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Misfortune (Su) A flue hag radiates an aura of misfortune in a 30 ft. radius. Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or suffer misfortune for 3 rounds. Anytime a creature affected by misfortune makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. Hags are immune to this ability. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag’s aura of misfortune for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Burst of Soot (Su) Twice per day a flue hag can belch forth a gout of blinding and choking soot, as a standard action. Any creature within a 20-foot radius burst must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become blinded and sickened for 2 rounds. Hags are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Searing Bite (Su) A flue hag’s jagged teeth are supernaturally hot, allowing her to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with her bite attack.
