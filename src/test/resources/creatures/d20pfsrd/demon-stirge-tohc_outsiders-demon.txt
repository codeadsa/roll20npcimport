SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drone (Su) At all times, save when using any spell-like abilities, the stirge demon drones and buzzes like a fly. All creatures within a 60-foot spread that hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall into a comatose sleep for 1d4 hours. There is no HD limit for this effect and it otherwise functions as the sleep spell (CL 10th). Note, the stirge demon can drain blood from a sleeping creature without automatically waking it up. In such an event, the sleeping creature receives a new Will save (same DC) each round the stirge demon drains blood. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
