SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su) When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the creature’s abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse’s innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree’s roots. Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree’s branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether–vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.
Gallows Tree Zombies (Ex) Each gallows tree has several gallows tree zombies connected to it. A Huge gallows tree may have no more than 7 gallows tree zombies connected to it at one time. A Gargantuan gallows tree can have a maximum of 11 zombies connected to it at any given time. See the gallows tree zombie entry for details on that monster.
Tremorsense (Ex) Gallows trees can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same vegetation the tree is touching.
