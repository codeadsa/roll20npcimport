SPECIAL ABILITIES
Drone (Su) The sound of a derakni in flight is a mesmerizing, unsettling drone that causes confusion in all non-demons who hear the sound. A derakni must fly at least 10 feet to activate this ability (which it can do as a free action as part of its move action). Any non-demon creature that begins its turn within 30 feet of a derakni that moved in this manner on its previous turn must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that makes this save is immune to the drone of that derakni for 24 hours. Demons are immune to this sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poison (Ex) Bite or sting—injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
