SPECIAL ABILITIES
Infectious Dance (Su) Any creature viewing a dancing maenad from within 60 feet of her must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by confusion for 1 hour. For every four creatures affected by this ability, the maenad gains 1d10 temporary hit points and her Charisma score increases by 1; these benefits end if the affected creatures break free of the dance.
Mad Feast (Su) As a full-round action, a maenad can conjure a supernatural feast. Creatures eating from this feast gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution, 1d8 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on fear saves for 12 hours. Creatures affected also take a –4 penalty on Will saving throws (this penalty does not apply on saves against fear), and find it more compelling to engage in debauchery, excess, and violence.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
