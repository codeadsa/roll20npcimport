SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bardic Magic (Su) Each day, the Spirit can cast any three bard spells of any level and in any combination (caster level 16th).
Inspiration (Su) The Spirit of Adoration can inspire an intelligent creature by giving it a token of her favor. As long as the creature carries her token, it gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks.
An inspired bard adds the spirit’s Charisma bonus (+6) to his number of bardic performance rounds per day. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast the spell status on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.
Stunning Ray (Su) This ray of brilliant energy has a range of 180 feet. The target takes 1d8 points of damage and is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 24 reduces this to dazzled). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Unearthly Grace (Su) The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, as well as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
