SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Confusion (Su) A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by that choronzon’s aura of confusion for one day. Other demons are immune to the choronzon’s aura of confusion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a choronzon can breathe forth a cone of bluish gas in a 40-foot cone. The gas lingers in the area for 1d2 rounds before dispersing. A creature killed by a choronzon’s breath weapon has its body break apart into its individual protons, neutrons, and electrons. Creatures killed in this manner can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
