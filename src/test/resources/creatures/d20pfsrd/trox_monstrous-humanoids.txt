SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frenzy (Ex) Once per day when a trox takes damage, it flies into a frenzy for 1 minute, gaining a +2 racial bonus to Constitution and Strength, but a –2 penalty to AC.
Grabbing Appendages (Ex) A trox’s smaller arms are useful for little more than aiding grappling. Trox gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main arms.
