SPECIAL ABILITIES
Heated Rock (Su) Smoke giants transfer the heat of their bodies to rocks as part of an attack action when they throw rocks. A heated rock deals 1d6 points of additional fire damage on a hit.
Smoke Form (Su) A smoke giant’s form is solid. As a free action it can change to a smoky form. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. In smoke form, a smoke giant can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). This ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell (caster level 9th).
