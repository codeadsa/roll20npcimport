SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Ex) A yetiâ€™s body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of damage to those that contact it for at least 1 round.
Frightful Gaze (Su) Creatures within 30 feet that meet the eyes of a yeti must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or stand paralyzed in fear (treat as a hold person spell) for 3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. An affected creature does not receive a saving throw each round to break the effects. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the frightful gaze of that yeti for one day.
Squeeze (Ex) A yeti that makes a successful grapple check against a Medium or smaller opponent pulls the opponent against its body and squeezes it with both arms, dealing 2d6+6 points of damage and d6 points of cold damage each round.
