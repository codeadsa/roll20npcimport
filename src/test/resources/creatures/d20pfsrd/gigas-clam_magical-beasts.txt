SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devastating Bite (Ex) A gigas clam’s bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
Poison (Ex) Siphon dart—injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str damage and paralysis; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Siphon Dart (Ex) A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications into needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet with no range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its Strength modifier, and possibly poisoning the target.
Siphon Jet (Ex) As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon to move a creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly away from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as a ship’s hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
