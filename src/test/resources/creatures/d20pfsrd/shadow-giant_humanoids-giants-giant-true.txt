SPECIAL ABILITIES
Militant (Ex) A shadow giant is proficient in all simple weapons, all martial weapons, and one exotic weapon of its choice.
Shadow Cloak (Ex) Because of the shadow giant’s connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a move action in any illumination other than direct sunlight, a shadow giant can cloak itself in moving shadows that act as the spell blur for 1d6+6 rounds. It can use this ability three times per day.
