SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fear Aura (Su) A bishop’s eerie, fish-like appearance evokes feelings of unsettling fear in foes within a 30-foot radius. The bishop can use this aura as a free action, and any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the bishop’s aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Stunning Strike (Ex) Five times per day, a bishop can stun a creature it hits with a claw attack. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
