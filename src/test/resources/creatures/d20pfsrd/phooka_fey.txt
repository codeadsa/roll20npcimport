SPECIAL ABILITIES
One with Nature (Su) When a phooka is slain through violence, all plants within a 100-foot radius of where it fell die and no new ones grow naturally in that area for 1 year.
Tree Stride (Su) As a free action, a phooka can enter a tree and move from it to another tree with 50 feet as if by a tree stride spell. A phooka can remain inside a tree as long as it wishes. This ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name.
