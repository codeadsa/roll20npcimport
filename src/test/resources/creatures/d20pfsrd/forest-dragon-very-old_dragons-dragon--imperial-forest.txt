SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) An adult or older forest dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field.
Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against the listener’s Sense Motive check.
Woodland Stride (Ex) As the druid ability of the same name.
