SPECIAL ABILITIES
Swallow Whole (Ex) When a Tylosarus begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its mouth (see Grab), it can attempt a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bludgeoning damage (2d6+12). A swallowed creature can escape by doing 9 points of damage to the inside of the Tylosarus with a light slashing or piercing weapon (AC 16). A creature that escapes the pin while swallowed whole emerges from the Tylosarus’s stomach, not its throat, where it may be grabbed and pinned again.
