SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bugle (Ex) The Stag can make a distinctive call that can be heard for miles. All who worship the god it serves immediately recognize the sound and know the direction and general distance to it.
Cascade of Spears (Su) Once per day, the Stag can shed fragments of its antlers, creating up to 18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination (or substitute five +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts for each spear). These weapons retain their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made of antler.
Heroes’ Feast (Sp) The Stag lies down and dies to begin the “casting” of this ability, its body becoming a magical feast feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next sunrise, it returns to life with full hit points.
Protective Aura (Su) This ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws, but only against attacks or effects from evil creatures.
