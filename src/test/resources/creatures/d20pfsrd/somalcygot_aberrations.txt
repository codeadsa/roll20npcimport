SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Spray (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a somalcygot can spit a 60-foot line of acid that deals 10d6 points of acid damage. The acid continues to burn, causing each affected creature to take an additional 5d6 points of acid damage on the following round. A successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates the ongoing damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Resistant Evolution (Su) Somalcygots have evolved in the harsh, unforgiving vacuum of space and developed fortified resistances to the myriad threats found in their environment, granting them a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
