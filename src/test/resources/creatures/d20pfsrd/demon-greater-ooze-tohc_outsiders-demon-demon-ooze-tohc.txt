SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) The acidic body of a greater ooze demon quickly dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it makes a successful DC 23 Reflex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a greater ooze demon dissolves immediately unless it makes a successful DC 23 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
The greater ooze demon’s acidic touch deals 23 points of acid damage per round to creatures or wooden or metal objects, but the greater ooze demon must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
