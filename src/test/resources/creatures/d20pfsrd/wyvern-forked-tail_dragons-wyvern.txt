SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a forked-tail wyvern can emit a cloud of noxious fire in a 30-foot cone that deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that take damage are also temporarily blinded by the fumes as though by glitterdust for 4 rounds. A DC 19 Reflex save halves the fire damage and negates the glitterdust effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
