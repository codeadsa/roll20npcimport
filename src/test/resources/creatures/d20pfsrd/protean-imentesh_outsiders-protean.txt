SPECIAL ABILITIES
Inflict Warpwave (Su)
As a standard action, an imentesh can inflict a warpwave upon any corporeal creature within 100 feet. The target can resist the warpwave’s effects with a DC 20 Fortitude save. If the imentesh wishes, it can use this ability as a swift action, but if it does so, it is affected by the warpwave as well unless it resists the effects with its own Fortitude save. See Table below for a list of possible effects caused by a warpwave. The save DC is Constitution-based.
