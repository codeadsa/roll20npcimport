SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fire Bolt (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a phlogiston bush can release a tiny bolt of fire in a line to a maximum range of 40 feet that deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature struck. A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Death Throes (Ex) If a phlogiston bush is reduced to 0 or less hit points, it explodes in a concussive blast of fire that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.
