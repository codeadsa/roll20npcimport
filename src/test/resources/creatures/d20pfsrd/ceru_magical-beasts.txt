SPECIAL ABILITIES
Luckbringer (Su) As a standard action, a ceru can bring luck or misfortune upon any creature it can see within 30 feet. This effect lasts for 1 round, and the ceru decides in advance whether the modified luck is good or bad. If the ceru grants bad luck, anytime the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A successful DC 13 Will save negates this effect. If the ceru grants good luck, the target must choose a single roll (as above) prior to rolling, and may roll the chosen roll twice and take the higher result. A creature can only be affected by this ability once per 24 hours, and the ceru may use the ability once per day for every 4 HD it has (minimum once per day). The save DC is Charisma-based. If the ceru is a familiar, it may use its master’s character level, if higher, in place of its racial Hit Dice for determining the number of uses of this ability, and for calculating the save DC (DC = 10 + 1/2 or the master’s character level + the master’s Cha modifier).
Poison (Ex) Gore–injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
