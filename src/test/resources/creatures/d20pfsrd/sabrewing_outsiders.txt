TACTICS
Sabrewings prefer to attack from the air, using speed to their advantage while also staying out of the reach of their opponents. Before combat, sabrewings usually cast magic weapon or greater magic weapon on their wings before engaging in combat so they can use their wings to the utmost advantage. Multiple sabrewings work in concert with one another to bring down foes; one draws an opponent’s attention while another swoops in from behind and slashes with its deadly wings.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Lasting Wound (Su) A wound caused by a sabrewing’s wing slash does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature damaged by the sabrewing’s wing slash must make a successful caster level check (DC 18), or the spell has no effect on the injured character. The check DC is Constitution-based.
See Invisible (Sp) A sabrewing can see invisible creatures as if using the see invisibility spell. This ability is always active. It can be negated, but the sabrewing can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
