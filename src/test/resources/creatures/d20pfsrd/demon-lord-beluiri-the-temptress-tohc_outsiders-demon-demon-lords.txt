TACTICS
Beluiri prefers subterfuge rather than directly assaulting an opponent. She usually alters her appearance to appear as an attractive member of a potential victim’s race; once the victim is lured in, she assumes her true form and attacks. If combat goes against her, she flees, but only after summoning lesser demons to cover her escape and kill her opponents.
