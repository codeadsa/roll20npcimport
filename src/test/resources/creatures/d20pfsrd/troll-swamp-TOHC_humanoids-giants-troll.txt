SPECIAL ABILITIES
Swamp Dependent (Ex) Swamp trolls keep their bodies covered in a thick coating of mud and swamp water. Without such a coating, they lose their regeneration ability and eventually suffocate. They can survive away from their murky home for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, they begin to suffocate. They cannot regenerate while subject to suffocation from being away from their swamp for too long.
