SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ethereal Escape (Su) The ethereal filcher is able to slip into the Ethereal Plane as a move action. It can remain in the Ethereal Plane for two rounds before it must use a move action to shift back to the Material Plane.
Magicsense (Su) Ethereal filchers can sense the presence of active magic spells and magic items (as the detect magic) spell within 60 ft. This sense is always active but can be fooled by spells that disguise magic auras or by areas of dead magic.
