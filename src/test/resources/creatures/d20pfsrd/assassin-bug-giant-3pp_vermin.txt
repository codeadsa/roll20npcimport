TACTICS
During Combat Depending on the disposition of the assassin bug, it is either an opportunistic ambush hunter that lies in wait for its prey to come close, or it actively seeks out its food. Regardless, when a victim is within range, the assassin bug leaps to the attack, attempting to grapple and pins its prey so it can inject it with its organ-dissolving saliva. A victim that dies is kept in the assassin bug’s lair for several weeks and feasted upon by it and any others in the nest, each taking a turn drinking the liquefied internals of the victim.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Liquefy Organs (Ex) An assassin bug that has pinned a foe can inject it with a corrosive poison that liquefies the prey’s insides, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. At Constitution 0, a creature dies as its bones and internal organs are liquefied. Creatures without internal organs or Constitution scores are immune to the ability damaging effects of the assassin bug’s liquefy organs attack.
Sticky Pads (Ex) An assassin bug’s forelegs are covered in thousands of tiny hairs that secrete a sticky residue aiding the creature in climbing as well as securing its prey. An assassin bug has a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks and on grapple checks (already figured into its statistics block).
