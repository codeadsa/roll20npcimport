SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crush (Ex) A demammoth can use its gigantic feet to crush creatures of Large size or smaller that are in its space. All targets in the affected area must succeed on a DC 31 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the demammoth moves off them. If the demammoth chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed on a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they do not escape. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Rumble Run (Ex) Whenever a demammoth moves twice its speed or faster in a single round, all creatures within 40 feet at any time during its movement that are standing on the ground must make a DC 31 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Sound Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a demammoth can make a loud blast of sound from its trunk, damaging those in the blast’s path. All creatures within a 400-foot line sustain 29d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened for 1d4 minutes. A successful Fortitude save (DC 33) reduces this damage by half and negates the deafening. All flying creatures held aloft with wings or other mundane means that fail the saving throw must succeed on a Fly check (DC 10 + damage sustained) or fall to the ground. If the creature maintains flight by a spell or spell-like ability, this ability also acts as greater dispel magic against such effects. The demmamoth’s effective caster level for this ability is 17. Additionally. all creatures within 100 feet of the demammoth when it uses its sound blast that are not in the sound burst’s line of effect must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 31) or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
