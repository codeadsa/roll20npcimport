SPECIAL ABILITIES
Screech (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a mobat can produce an ear-splitting screech that stuns non-mobats in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures within the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d3 rounds. Other mobats and urdefhans are immune to this effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
