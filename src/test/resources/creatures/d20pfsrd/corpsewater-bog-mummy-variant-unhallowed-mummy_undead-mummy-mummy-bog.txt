SPECIAL ABILITIES
Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a corpsewater bog mummy must make a DC 17 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy’s despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Swamp Crumble (Su) Instead of the standard mummy rot, corpsewater mummies infect their victims with a foul curse known as swamp crumble.
Curse and disease—slam; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex, 1d3 Con, and 1d3 Cha; cure —. Otherwise treated as mummy rot, this disease causes the victim’s bones to become brittle and dissolve; upon death, only the skin, internal organs, and other soft tissues remain.
A side effect of swamp crumble is that the victim’s hair becomes tinged with red, with light-colored hair turning as red as fresh blood.
