SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sardonic Laugh (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a bronze giant can unleash a bellowing laugh that strikes fear into the hearts of any creature within 100 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 20 Will save are unaffected and immune to the sardonic laugh of that bronze giant for 24 hours. On a failed save, that creature is shaken for as long as it remains within 100 feet of the bronze giant and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.
