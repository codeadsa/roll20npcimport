SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a fungus gargoyle can breathe a line of deadly spores to a range of 10 feet. A living creature struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. Thereafter, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save each minute (10 rounds) or take 1 point of Strength damage. This cycle continues until the creature dies or receives a remove disease spell. A successful DC 20 Heal check or a delay poison spell slows the continuing damage to 1 point per hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Sickening Aura (Su) As a free action, a fungus gargoyle can emanate an aura that smells like rotting vegetable matter in a 10-foot radius. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterwards. The save DC is Constitution-based.
