SPECIAL ABILITIES
Euphoric Slime (Ex) Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm’s viscous ability must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter and be effectively staggered for that round. This is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.
Viscous (Ex) Whenever an alchemical ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a creature of Small size or larger, that creature must make a DC 13 Reflex save or be covered in patches of sticky ooze globules. Those who fail are entangled until the patches of ooze are removed. The ooze can be removed by spending a full-round action to fling off the globules—though this action might be impeded by the ooze’s effects. If a creature affected by this ability takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
