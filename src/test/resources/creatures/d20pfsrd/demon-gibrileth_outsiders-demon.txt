SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease Any weapon a gibrileth wields becomes a vector for spreading the demonplague. A creature bitten by a gibrileth or damaged by a weapon it wields is exposed to this virulent disease. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save is needed to resist this creature’s particular strain of demonplague. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Tumors (Su) As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruit-sized tumor from its body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage, and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a successful DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Whip Specialist (Ex) A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.
