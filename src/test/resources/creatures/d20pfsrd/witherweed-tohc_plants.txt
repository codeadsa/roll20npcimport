SPECIAL ABILITIES
Camouflage (Ex) A witherweed looks like normal grass and weeds when at rest; it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.
Death Smoke (Ex) A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a 20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6 points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
The cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
