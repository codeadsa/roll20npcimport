SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A dun pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers damage from a dun pudding’s acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 20 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a dun pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. If a dun pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a dun pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
