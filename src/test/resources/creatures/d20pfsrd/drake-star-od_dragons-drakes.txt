SPECIAL ABILITIES
Nimbus of Stars (Su) A star drake has a continual supply of tiny motes surrounding its body. Any non-blind creatures within 10 ft. of the drake must make a DC 24 Fortitude save (Con-based) or become dazed. Those who succeed are still dazzled by the nimbus. These effects last while the creature is within the aura and an additional round after the creature leaves.
Searing Star (Su) Once every 10 rounds, a star drake can gather up energy from its nimbus, reducing its effective range to 5 ft., in order to create a powerful globe of energy. By succeeding at a ranged touch attack, the drake strikes an opponent with the globe, which explodes for 6d8 force damage and blinds the target (a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw prevents the blindness but not the damage). Against outsiders without the native subtype, the damage increases to 18d8.
