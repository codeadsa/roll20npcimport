SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a spine dragon can emit a devastating shriek of powerful sonic energy in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 20d6 sonic damage and are permanently deafened. A DC 27 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the deafness. This sonic damage is particularly devastating to constructs—they take a –4 penalty to save against its effects, and if they fail the save, they are staggered for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Ray Deflection (Su) A spine dragon’s scales deflect rays and magic missile spells, rendering the spine dragon immune to such effects. There’s a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise, it is simply negated.
Spines (Ex) A spine dragon’s body is covered with long, crystalline spines. It can fire up to four of these spines per round as a full-attack action (or one as a standard action). A creature that attacks a spine dragon with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must make a DC 20 Reflex save or take 2d8+11 points of piercing damage from the spines. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
