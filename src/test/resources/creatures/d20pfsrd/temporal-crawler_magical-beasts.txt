SPECIAL ABILITIES
Slowing Webs (Ex) The web of a temporal crawler emanates a slow effect (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save the round they are affected to negate the effects. Creatures are slowed as long as they stay within 10 feet of a web. The slow effects can be counterspelled with the successful casting of a haste spell if the caster makes a successful caster level check (DC 16) before casting the haste spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A temporal crawler can fire a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the temporal crawler.
An entangled creature can attempt a DC 19 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 19 Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are both Constitution-based and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
Temporal crawlers often create sticky sheets of webbing up to 20 feet square. Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 10 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/ magic.
Foresight (Su) A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a temporal crawler from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the temporal crawler an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the temporal crawler can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Temporal crawlers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
