SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A smoke dragonâ€™s breath weapon is a 20 ft. cone of thick, black smoke. Creatures caught in the smoke must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated as they choke and cough. A creature that chokes for 3 or more consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 2 HD of the smoke dragon.
Smoke Form (Ex) Once per day, a smoke dragon can assume a smoky form as a move action. It can spend up to 1 minute per day per HD in smoke form. This time does not have to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. A smoke form dragon can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). The ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell.
