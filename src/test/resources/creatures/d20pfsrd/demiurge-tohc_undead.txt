SPECIAL ABILITIES
Soul Touch (Su) A demiurge can damage a creature’s soul by moving through a space occupied by the creature. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The target can resist the attack by succeeding on a DC 18 Will save. If the save fails, the target dies as the shock of unlife permeates its soul. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same demiurge’s soul touch for one day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Transfixing Gaze (Su) Any creature within 30 feet meeting the demiurge’s gaze must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be transfixed for one minute as if affected by a hold person spell (caster level 10th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects.
Vulnerability to Iron (Ex) A cold iron weapon ignores the demiurge’s incorporeal state and deals normal damage.
