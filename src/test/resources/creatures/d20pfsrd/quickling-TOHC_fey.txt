SPECIAL ABILITIES
Natural Invisibility (Su) A quickling is invisible when motionless. It loses this invisibility and remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes any action other than a free action.
Poison Use (Ex) A quickling is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They usually use kava leaf poison on their daggers.
Kava Leaf Poison
Type ingestion or injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/min. for 2 min.; effect sleep 1 hour; cure 1 save. Supernatural Speed (Su) A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains motionless (at which point it is invisible), a quickling’s shape blurs and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as the rogue abilities of the same name).
Slow Susceptibility (Ex) A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed ability and is sickened.
