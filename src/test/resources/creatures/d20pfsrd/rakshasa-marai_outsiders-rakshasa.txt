SPECIAL ABILITIES
Confusion (Su) A creature bitten by a marai’s bite (from either its actual mouth or the snakes it has for hands) must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai’s six snake arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC 19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds. Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19). Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round. Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered for 1 round. Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round. Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone. Spells A marai casts arcane spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
