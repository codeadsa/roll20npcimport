SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid ability of the same name. The nixie’s total includes a +8 racial bonus on wild empathy checks.
Captivating Song (Su) This works like the harpy ability of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su) This works as polymorph, and allows the bog nixie to assume the form of any Small or Medium aquatic animal or humanoid.
Minor Wish (Sp) Once per day, a bog nixie can create a magical effect in exchange for a gift or service from a humanoid. The power of this “wish” is no greater than what can be done with a 3rd-level spell.
