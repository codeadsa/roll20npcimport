SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con and 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Spit (Ex) A spitting eurypterid can expel a high-pressure jet of water from a vent just below its mouth with startling accuracy and force. This spit attack is equally effective above or below water, creating a 40-foot line that inflicts 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures in the area of effect. In addition, creatures that take damage from this jet of water are stunned for 1 round. A DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. Once a spitting eurypterid uses this ability, it cannot use it again until it takes a full-round action while completely submerged to draw more water into its body. The save DC is Constitution-based.
