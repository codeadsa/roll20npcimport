SPECIAL ABILITIES
Soul Lock (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a shoki can use its +2 cold iron quarterstaff to capture the soul of a creature at the threshold of death—any undead creature or any living being with 0 or fewer hit points. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be slain (if living) or disrupted (if undead), its spirit locked within the shoki’s staff. A corporeal undead transforms into a corpse if affected by this ability, while an incorporeal undead is trapped bodily within the staff (this ability negates a ghost’s ability to rejuvenate). A spirit trapped within a shoki’s staff cannot be returned to life through any means short of miracle, true resurrection, or wish. A trapped soul can be freed if the shoki wills it, or by casting banishment, dismissal, or freedom upon the staff. The trapped soul can also be freed by destroying the staff. A shoki’s staff can contain only one soul at a time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
