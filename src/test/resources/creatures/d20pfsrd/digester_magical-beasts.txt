SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Spray (Ex) A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot cone, dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in that area. The digester can also choose to deliver a concentrated stream of acid that deals 8d8 points of damage against a single target within 5 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage for both the cone and the stream. A digester may only use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
