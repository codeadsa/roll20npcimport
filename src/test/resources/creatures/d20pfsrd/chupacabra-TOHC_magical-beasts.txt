TACTICS
A chupacabra attacks with its razor-sharp claws and powerful bite, striking from ambush whenever possible. If a chupacabra grabs a foe, it slashes its throat open and sucks out its blood. If facing only one foe, a chupacabra maintains its grapple until it has drained all of its opponent’s blood. When it kills an opponent, the chupacabra tears it to shreds and gorges itself on as much of the foe’s blood as it can.
