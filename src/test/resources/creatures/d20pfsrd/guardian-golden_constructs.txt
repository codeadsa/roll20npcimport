SPECIAL ABILITIES
Conductivity (Ex) A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up a golden guardian (as the haste spell) for 1d4 rounds. A golden guardian gets no saving throw against electricity effects.
Heat (Ex) A golden guardian’s body generates intense heat, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples. Creatures attacking a golden guardian with unarmed strikes or natural weapons are also subject to the golden guardian’s heat.
Molten Destruction (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points, a golden guardian superheats and instantly melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread take 6d6 points of fire damage; a DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Heat Shimmer (Ex) The intense heat radiating from a golden guardian’s body creates a wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see clearly. This functions as a blur spell (CL 8th), except it cannot be dispelled.
