SPECIAL ABILITIES
Corpse Lure (Ex) By setting a corpse atop its stump and riddling the body with small, extruded filaments, a wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing can crudely maneuver the corpse, manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing’s tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing). When a wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing uses a corpse like this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.
Implant (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing can infest a creature with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host’s gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host’s belly with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any similar effect) also kills an implanted egg.
Wolf-in-Sheep’s-Clothing Egg: Infestation—ingestion; save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
