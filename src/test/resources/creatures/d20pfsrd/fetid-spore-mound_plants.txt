SPECIAL ABILITIES
Compressible Form (Ex) A fetid spore mound is difficult to harm with piercing and bludgeoning attacks, gaining DR 10/slashing and taking half damage from falls. It also never takes penalties for squeezing into a 5-foot-wide space and gains a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks (+20 when squeezing through tight spaces).
Electric Fortitude (Ex) A fetid spore mound takes no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against it temporarily increases its Constitution score by 1d4 points. The fetid spore mound loses these temporary points at the rate of 1 per hour.
Spore Discharge (Ex) If struck in combat, a fetid spore mound discharges a cloud of yellow mold spores in a 10-foot radius. Exposure to direct sunlight renders the spore mound’s yellow mold dormant, and it does not discharge. Its spore discharge is suppressed for 1 round if the creature is struck by a fire attack that overcomes its fire resistance.
Yellow mold spores: inhaled; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 1 save.
