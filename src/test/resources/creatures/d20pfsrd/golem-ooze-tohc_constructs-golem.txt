SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) An ooze golem’s body secretes a deadly acid that damages only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures attacking an ooze golem unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the ooze golem’s slam attack.
Amorphous (Ex) An ooze golem’s body is malleable and shapeless. It can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eight its space when squeezing.
Death Throes (Ex) When an ooze golem is reduced to 0 or less hit points its body collapses into a bubbling pool of acidic slime that covers a 10-foot square area. Creatures touching this acidic pool take 2d6 points of acid damage (no save) for 1d3 rounds. The acid pool remains for 10 rounds (1 minute) before dispersing.
Fast Healing (Ex) An ooze golem heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
