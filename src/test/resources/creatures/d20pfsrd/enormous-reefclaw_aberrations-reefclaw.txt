TACTICS
During Combat The reefclaw knows that the barge and pier belong to its Arkona allies, and does its best not to damage them. The same gentle touch is not extended to the PCs—the monster attacks anyone it recognizes as intruders with a ferocious rage.
Morale The enormous reefclaw gives up the fight if reduced to less than 20 hit points, swimming swiftly out to sea to seek new allies. It does not return.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Frenzy (Su) When a reefclaw is killed, its body spasms horrifically. Immediately upon dying, the reefclaw makes a full attack action against all creatures it threatens. If more than one creature is within reach, it makes each attack against a random target (even against other reefclaws).
Grab (Ex) A reefclaw can use its grab ability on a target of any size. Reefclaws have a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks; this bonus replaces the normal +4 bonus a creature with grab receives.
Poison (Ex) Claw—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
