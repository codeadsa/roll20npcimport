SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Drain (Ex) A baobhan sith can suck blood from a grappled or helpless opponent; if she establishes or maintains a pin, she deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round.
Captivating Dance (Su) When a baobhan sith dances, all living creatures within 30 feet that view the rhythmic swaying and movements of her body must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become utterly enthralled and captivated. Creatures that are sexually attracted to females who view this dance suffer a –2 penalty on their saving throws. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected again by the same baobhan sith’s captivating dance for one day. A captivated creature is dazed (it cannot attack, but can defend normally). This continues for as long as the baobhan sith dances. A baobhan sith can move and act normally (including using her spell-like abilities) while maintaining her dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Dying Words (Sp) When a baobhan sith is slain, she utters a curse as a free action (whether it’s her turn or not) that affects her killer as if it were a bestow curse spell (caster level 10th). The target can resist the curse with a successful DC 19 Will save. If the save fails, the target suffers a –6 decrease to its highest ability score. The save DC is Charisma-based.
