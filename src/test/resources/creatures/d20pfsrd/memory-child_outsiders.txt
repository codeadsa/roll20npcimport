SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mind Flood (Su) As a standard action and by touching an opponent, a memory child floods the opponent’s mind with every single thought the child has ever collected from those that have come into contact with it. This effect overloads the opponent’s brain dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour (treat as a confusion spell, caster level equals the memory child’s Hit Dice). A successful DC 16 Will save negates the stunning effect and reduces the confusion effect to 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. This ability is always active but can be suppressed or restarted by the memory child as a free action.
Thought Consumption (Su) A memory child can drain an opponent’s thoughts and memories by touch. (The opponent retains its memories; the memory child just copies them). By making a successful melee touch attack, a memory child deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage to its opponent. A memory child must consume at least 4 points of Intelligence each day or it suffers the effects of starvation.
