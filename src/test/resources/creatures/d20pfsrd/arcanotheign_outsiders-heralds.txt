SPECIAL ABILITIES
Corporeal Form (Ex) As an immediate action, the herald can take physical form, losing its incorporeal special quality and subtype and its deflection bonus to AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to its incorporeal deflection bonus.
Eldritch Blast (Su) The herald chooses an additional effect for its eldritch blasts each round (DC 26 negates). A creature that fails its saves against both blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is affected by maze. Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire. Energy Channel Aura (Su) On its turn, the herald can channel energy (Will DC 26 half) to deal 2d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to each creature in its aura. A creature struck by its incorporeal touch attack also takes this damage (no saving throw). The save DC is Charisma-based.
