SPECIAL ABILITIES
Constrict (Ex) Because it seizes its victims by the neck, a creature in the hangman tree’s grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
Hallucinatory Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman’s tree for 24 hours.
Paralyzed by Cold (Ex) Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a hold person spell.
Slowed by Darkness (Ex) Spells that generate darkness (such as darkness or deeper darkness) slow the hangman’s tree (as the slow spell) for 1 round per caster level.
Vines (Ex) The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree’s vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a –4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.
