SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cloud Breath (Su) A great wyrm cloud dragon’s breath weapon creates a cloud that persists in its cone shape for 1d4 rounds. Treat this cloud as a fog cloud that deals electricity damage equal to half the Dragon’s breath weapon damage to any creature that ends its turn still within the cloud (Reflex save halves the damage—DC equals the dragon’s breath weapon save DC).
Cloud Form (Su) An adult or older cloud dragon can change itself into a cloudy vapor as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as gaseous form but the dragon’s fly speed is unchanged.
Mist Vision (Su) A cloud dragon can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects with perfect clarity.
Thundering Bite (Su) An ancient or older cloud dragon’s bite makes a thundering crash whenever it attacks, dealing an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage. A great wyrm’s thundering bite deals an additional 4d6 sonic damage.
