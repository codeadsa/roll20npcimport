SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shriek (Ex) Light sources or movement within 10 feet of a shrieker causes it to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. All creatures within 30 feet of a shrieker when it emits this noise must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d4 sonic damage each round. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same shrieker’s noise for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Mental Blast (Ex) These shriekers emit a high, piercing sound, but also send out penetrating mental waves that stun nearby creatures. All creatures within 30 feet of a mindstab fungus when it shrieks must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or become stunned for 1d4+1 round. The mindstab fungus can emit this mental blast every 1d6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same mindstab fungus’s stun for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting charm effect.
