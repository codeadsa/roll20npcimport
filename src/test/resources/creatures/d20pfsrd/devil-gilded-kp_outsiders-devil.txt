SPECIAL ABILITIES
Betrayal of Riches (Su) A gilded devil can turn rings, necklaces, and other jewelry against their wearer as a standard action. The devil can affect any visible item of jewelry within 200 ft., twisting and constricting it into cruel barbs and spikes. The item receives a DC 21 Will save (Cha-based) to avoid this effect. The victim takes 3d6 damage and a possible additional effect based on the item slot targeted.
Slot Save Effect
Arms or Wrist Fort 1d4 Strength damage
Hand Fort 1d4 Dexterity damage
Eyes Reflex Permanently blinded
Head Fort 1d4 Charisma damage
Feet Reflex Speed halved for 24 hours
Neck Fort Stunned, unable to breathe for 1 round
Other slot — No additional effect
An item is treated as jewelry if it is made of a precious material (such as silver, gold, ivory, and adamantine), adorned with gems, or both, and is worth at least 100 gp.
All save DCs are Charisma-based.
Liar’s Largess (Su) A gilded devil has influence over the recipient of a gift for as long as that creature retains the gift. The recipient receives a -2 penalty on saving throws against the gilded devil’s abilities and a further -10 penalty against scrying attempts made by the gilded devil. A successful remove curse or break enchantment against CL 11th removes this effect.
Scorn Base Metals (Su) A gilded devil’s attacks ignore any armor or shield bonus provided by armor made of bronze, iron, steel, or similar metals. Armor and shield bonuses provided by valuable metals such as adamantine, mithral, and gold apply, as do bonuses provided by non-metallic objects or cold iron.
Scourge of Avarice (Su) As a free action, a gilded devil wearing jewelry worth at least 1,000 gp can reshape it into a +2 heavy flail. A creature struck by this jeweled flail takes 1 point of Wisdom damage, in addition to normal weapon damage. The flail reverts to its base components 1 minute after it leaves the devil’s grasp, or upon the gilded devil’s death.
Voracious Greed (Ex) As a standard action, a gilded devil can consume precious metals or gems worth up to 1,000 gp. For each 200 gp consumed, it heals 5 hp of damage. A gilded devil can use this ability against the worn items of an opponent by pinning a foe and succeeding at an opposed grapple check. Magical or attended items receive a DC 19 Reflex save (Con-based) to avoid being consumed.
