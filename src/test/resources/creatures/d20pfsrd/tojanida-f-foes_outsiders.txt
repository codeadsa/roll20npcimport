TACTICS
Underwater, a tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent away from its allies. They have also been known to grab drowning creatures and take them to safety.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ink Cloud (Ex) A tojanida can emit a 30-ft. radius cloud of ink once per minute as a free action. This cloud provides total concealment. The ink persists for one minute. On land, the tojanida can spray ink at an opponent to blind them for five rounds. A DC 15 Reflex save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
