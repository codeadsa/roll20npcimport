SPECIAL ABILITIES
Maker’s Gift (Ex) Each yaoguai gains one additional ability that is based on its specific form. Typical additional yaoguai abilities include the following.
Flight: The yaoguai gains a fly speed of 30 feet (clumsy). Grab and Constrict: The yaoguai’s tentacle attack gains grab and constrict. The creature’s constrict damage is equal to its slam damage plus its Strength bonus. Poison: One claw or tentacle attack is replaced with a sting attack (same damage as the replaced attack) plus poison.

Poison Sting—injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Pounce and Rake: The yaoguai gains pounce and rake (2 claws +14, 1d8+7). Quills: A creature attacking the yaoguai with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d8+7 points of piercing damage from the yaoguai’s quills. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way. Trample: The yaoguai gains a trample attack that deals an amount of damage equal to its claw damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Polymorph Susceptibility (Su) A yaoguai is immune to polymorph effects or effects that otherwise change its shape, but the attempt to alter its shape causes it great pain and it must attempt a saving throw if the effect allows it. If it fails its save or the effect doesn’t allow a saving throw, the yaoguai is staggered and loses its damage reduction and fast healing for 1d4 rounds.
