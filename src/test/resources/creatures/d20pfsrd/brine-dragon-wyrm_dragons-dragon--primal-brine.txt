SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) An old or older brine dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger the ship is than the brine dragon’s size, the dragon takes a cumulative –10 penalty on the check.
Desiccating Bite (Su) An Ancient brine dragon’s bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm’s bite deals 1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the Dragon’s breath weapon save DC) negates the Strength drain.
