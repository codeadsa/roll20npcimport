SPECIAL ABILITIES
Whistle (Su) A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within 50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake’s whistle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A bard‘s countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.
