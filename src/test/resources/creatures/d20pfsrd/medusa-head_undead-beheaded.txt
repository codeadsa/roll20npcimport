SPECIAL ABILITIES
Petrifying Bite (Su) Creatures bitten by a medusa head must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or turn to stone for 1d4 rounds. Targets immune to poison are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Variants The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in any way and applied to any of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount.
Belching (+1 CR) A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type (acid, cold, electric, or fire) chosen at the time of the beheaded’s animation.
Example: Belching Medusa Head
Burning (+1 CR) This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be any color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn (1d6) special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 14.
Example: Burning Medusa Head
Grabbing (+0 CR) This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple any creature of Medium size or smaller in this way.
Example: Grabbing Medusa Head
Screaming (+0 CR) Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chilling scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save (DC 14) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same beheaded’s scream for 24 hours.
Example: Screaming Medusa Head
