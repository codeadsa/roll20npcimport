SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Frenzy (Ex) Once per day, a sahuagin that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy in the following round. It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, but takes a –2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts as long as the battle or 1 minute, whichever is shorter.
Speak with Sharks (Su) A sahuagin can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 150 feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as “come here,” “defend me,” or “attack this target.”
