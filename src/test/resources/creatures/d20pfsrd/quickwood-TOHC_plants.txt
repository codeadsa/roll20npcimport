TACTICS
Quickwoods use their remote sensing ability to keep tabs on their surroundings. If trespassers are detected, the creature simply waits until one or more come within range of its roots before lashing out and striking. A grabbed opponent is pulled in close to the creature’s maw and bitten.
A typical quickwood (11 HD) has 9 roots it uses to grab foes. For every 2 HD above 11, a quickwood has one additional root it can use in combat (thus, a 13 HD quickwood has 10 roots and a 15 HD quickwood has 11 roots).

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fear Aura (Su) If a quickwood is targeted by a spell (excluding area spells) and it makes its save against the spell’s effects, it takes no damage and absorbs some of the spell’s energy and releases it as a fear effect (as a free action) in a 10-foot radius per level of the spell. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as by a fear spell (caster level 11th). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
Grasping Roots (Ex) If a quickwood hits with a root attack, it can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and drags the foe 30 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity). A quickwood can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A root has hardness 2 and 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a quickwood’s root does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the root is currently grappling a target, the quickwood takes a -4 penalty on its CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a root deals no damage to a quickwood.
Immunity to Fire (Ex) A quickwood can perspire as a free action; this grants it immunity to fire for one hour. Afterwards, it must wait one minute before using this ability again.
Remote Sensing (Su) As a standard action, a quickwood can use a normal oak tree within 360 feet as a magical sensor to view its surroundings. This ability is similar to a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and allows a quickwood to see (including with darkvision) and hear through a sensor. A quickwood does not need line of sight to establish a sensor. A quickwood can establish a new magical sensor in another tree within range as a free action, though it can never have more sensors at one time than its Hit Dice. A quickwood with multiple sensors can switch between them as a free action.
An oak tree utilized as a magical sensor takes on a human-like visage (similar to a quickwood). A successful DC 20 Perception check allows a character to notice the tree’s visage.
