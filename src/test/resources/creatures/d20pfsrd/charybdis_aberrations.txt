SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rending Claws (Ex) A charybdis’s claws are particularly devastating when used against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of an object’s hardness rating.
Vortex (Su) A charybdis can generate a whirlpool as a standard action at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack, but the whirlpool can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. It’s a DC 25 Reflex save to avoid being caught by the charybdis’s vortex. The vortex itself is 20 feet across and 120 feet deep, and deals 2d6+12 points of damage per round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
