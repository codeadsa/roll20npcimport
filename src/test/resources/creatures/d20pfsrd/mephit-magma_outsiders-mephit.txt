SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Each type of mephit can unleash a particular breath weapon every 4 rounds as a standard action. The DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
The breath weapon of a magma mephit is a cone of fire that deals 1d8 fire damage.
Magma Form (Su) Once per hour, a magma mephit can assume the form of a pool of lava, 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep. While in this form, its DR increases to 20/magic and it cannot attack. It can move at a speed of 10 feet per round and can pass through small openings and cracks. Anything touching this pool takes 1d6 fire damage. A magma mephit may remain in this form for up to 10 minutes.
