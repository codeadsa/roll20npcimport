+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, –2 Wisdom: Fetchlings are quick and forceful, but often strange and easily distracted by errant thoughts. Darkvision: Fetchlings see in the dark up to 60 feet. Low-Light Vision: Fetchlings can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
Skilled: Fetchlings have a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (planes) and Stealth checks. Shadow Blending: Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment; it just increases the miss chance. Shadowy Resistance: Fetchlings have cold resistance 5 and electricity resistance 5. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): A fetchling can use disguise self once per day as a spell-like ability. It can assume the form of any humanoid creature using this spell-like ability. When a fetchling reaches 9th level in any combination of classes, it gains shadow walk (self only) as a spell-like ability usable once per day, and at 13th level, it gains plane shift (self only, to the Plane of Shadow or the Material Plane only) usable once per day. A fetchling’s caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice. Languages Fetchlings begin play speaking Common. A fetchling with a high Intelligence score can choose any of the following languages: Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Draconic, D’ziriak (understanding only, cannot speak), Ignan, Terran, and any regional human tongue.
