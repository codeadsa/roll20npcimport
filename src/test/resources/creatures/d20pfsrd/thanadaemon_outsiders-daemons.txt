SPECIAL ABILITIES
Draining Weapon (Su) A thanadaemon’s energy drain attack functions through any melee weapon it wields.
Fear Gaze (Su) Cower in fear for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 21 negates. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Soul Crush (Su) A thanadaemon can crush a soul gem (see cacodaemon) as a standard action to gain fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. This action condemns the crushed soul to Abaddon—resurrecting this victim requires a DC 28 caster level check.
