SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A trapper’s acid does not harm wood or stone.
Smother (Ex) A trapper can try to wrap a creature up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The trapper attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals slam and acid damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit an engulfing trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
