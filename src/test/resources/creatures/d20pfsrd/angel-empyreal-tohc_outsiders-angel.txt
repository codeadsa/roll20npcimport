SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Goodness (Su) An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form. Any non-evil creature in this area must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to attack the empyreal that round.
Evil creatures within the area must make a successful DC 23 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus.
Radiant Blast (Su) Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.
