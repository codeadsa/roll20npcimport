SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fast Healing (Ex) A rock troll heals only if it is underground and touching dirt or earth.
Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) A rock troll exposed to sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) can only take a single move or attack action and is instantly turned to stone (as if by a flesh to stone spell) in the next round if its fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This effect is permanent, but can be dispelled if the rock troll is removed from the source of the sunlight and stone to flesh is cast on it. A rock troll must make a new saving throw each round it remains in sunlight.
