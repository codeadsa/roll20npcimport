SPECIAL ABILITIES
Earth Glide (Ex) A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent’s armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and devoured by the khargra. Damaged armor gains the broken condition.
Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent’s weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield’s hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra’s sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.
It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.
Vulnerabilities (Ex) A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save). A transmute metal to wood deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 17 + caster’s ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.
