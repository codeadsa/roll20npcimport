SPECIAL ABILITIES
Unholy Nimbus (Su) Three times per day as a free action a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of unholy light, causing nauseating beams of writhing color to play around its body. One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot radius. Any non-demon creature caught within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The save DC is Charisma-based.
