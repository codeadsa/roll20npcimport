SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Insanity (Su) Creatures with less than 6 HD that view a tentacled horror must make a DC 23 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 12th). Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a charm person spell, caster level 12th). Only a restoration, greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell can restore the mind of one driven insane by a tentacled horror. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes +2 for its Ability Focus feat.
Horn (Su) The source of a tentacled horror’s power is its horn. If a tentacled horror’s horn is removed, it loses its regeneration ability and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution until the horn is reattached. The horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror’s horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40 Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror’s horn.
