Jolt (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds, a dire electric eel can generate a powerful jolt of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet of the eel suffer 4d8 points of electricity damage and are stunned for 1d6 rounds. Those within 10 feet suffer 2d8 points of electricity damage and are stunned for 1d3 rounds. Creatures no farther away than 15 feet suffer 1d8 points of electricity damage and are stunned for 1 round. A DC 13 Fortitude save halves this damage and negates stunning. The save DC is Constitution-based.
