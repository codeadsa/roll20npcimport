SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) Though it is a Tiny monster, the hood can drop onto the head of a Medium or smaller creature as a standard action. If the hood’s attack succeeds, it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its target and constrict. The hood’s crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly around its victim, seeking entry into the creature’s ears, nose, and throat, making it difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the hood and its grappled target inside.
Strangle (Ex) A grappling executioner’s hood entirely covers its opponent’s head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see suffocation) unless it doesn’t speak or breathe through its head.
Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex) Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it causes 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a grappled target.
