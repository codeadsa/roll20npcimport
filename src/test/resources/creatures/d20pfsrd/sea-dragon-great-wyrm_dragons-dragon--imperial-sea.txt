SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A young or older sea dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Sea Strider (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, an old or older sea dragon can move from one body of water to another as if using the teleport spell (self only).
Tidal Wave (Su) Once per day, a great wyrm sea dragon can create a tidal wave. This ability is the same as the bronze dragon’s ability of the same name (see full text at right.)
Torrent Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of super-heated steam, a very young or older sea dragon can breathe a line of pressurized water twice the length of the sea dragon’s cone breath weapon. This line deals bludgeoning damage.
Unfettered Swimmer (Su) A juvenile sea dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its swim speed. The sea dragon’s swim speed continues to increase by an additional 10 feet every two age categories. Furthermore, while swimming, the sea dragon is treated as if under the effects of the spell freedom of movement.

Brett, d20pfsrd Beastmaster I Tidal Wave (full text)
A great wyrm sea dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of the shore—treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche. Treat all creatures as if they were in the bury zone. The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the dragon’s breath weapon DC. Those who fail their saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20 feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits.
