SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A verdurous ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal quickly. Each time a creature takes damage from the ooze’s acid, its metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a greater verdurous ooze takes 1d8 points of acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 25 Reflex save. If a greater verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 25 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Sleep Aura (Su) The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 60-foot radius. All living creatures within the area must make a DC 24 Will save or fall asleep for a number of rounds equal to the ooze’s HD. Creatures immune to poison are also immune to this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze’s sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a verdurous ooze. Instead, if the verdurous ooze would have taken 10 or more points of damage from a single slashing or piercing attack, it splits into two identical oozes, each with half of the original’s current hit points (round down). Slashing or piercing attacks that deal less than 10 points of damage do not cause a verdurous ooze to split. Damage from multiple slashing or piercing attacks is not cumulative. A verdurous ooze with 15 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
