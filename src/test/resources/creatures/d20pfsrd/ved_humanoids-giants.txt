SPECIAL ABILITIES Gale Breath (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, a ved can draw in a mighty breath and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone. Targets within 10 feet of the origin of this cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone. Those who succeed at the check or are standing farther away from the ved treat the effects of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell.
