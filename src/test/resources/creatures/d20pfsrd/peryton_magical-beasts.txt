SPECIAL ABILITIES
Horrific Critical (Ex) A peryton’s gore attack threatens a critical hit on an 18–20. If a peryton kills a humanoid foe with a critical hit, it can tear out the victim’s heart with its wolf-like teeth as a free action. Any creature that witnesses this savage event must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shadow Mark (Su) As a free action, a peryton can make a ranged touch attack by flying over a humanoid target—the maximum range of this attack is 300 feet. If the peryton hits, its shadow transforms to match the shadow of the creature struck. Once a peryton has established this link, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made against that target, and every time the peryton hits that target with an attack, the creature must make a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
