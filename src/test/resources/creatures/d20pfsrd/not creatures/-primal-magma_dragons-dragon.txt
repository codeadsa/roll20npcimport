SPECIAL ABILITIES
Magma Tomb (Su) Once per day, a great wyrm magma dragon can spit lava onto a target within 120 feet, dealing damage normally for its breath weapon. This magma cools instantly—it does not continue doing damage at this point but does entrap the victim (DC equals the dragon’s breath weapon save DC, 3d6 minutes, hardness 8, hp 45).
Magma Breath (Su) Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone of lava instead of fire. The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3 rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust.
Spell-like Abilities (Sp) A magma dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) upon reaching the listed age category.
Very young—burning hands Juvenile—scorching ray Adult—wall of fire Old—fire shield (warm shield, constant) Ancient—delayed blast fireball (3/day) Great wyrm—wall of lava* (1/day) * This spell is from the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide. Superheated (Su) At young age and older, a magma dragon’s bite attack deals additional fire damage equal to its age category.
