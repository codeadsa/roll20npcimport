SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attach (Ex) When not already joined to a host body, a possessor can attempt to swallow the head of a medium or small humanoid. If its bite attack hits, the possessor can attempt to grapple the humanoid as a free action. While attached to an opponent, the possessor can still use its mental assault or tentacles against other foes. The swallowed creature is subject to the creature’s dominance.
Dominance (Ex) When attached to a possessor, the host creature suffers 1 point of Intelligence and Charisma damage per round. If a creature is reduced to 0 Intelligence or 0 Charisma, the possessor bonds with the creature and assumes control it. The possessor then has access to all the host’s motor functions, class abilities, skills, feats and equipment. If a host creature is able to break free of the possessor’s attachment, it suffers 1 point of Intelligence and Charisma drain. Being a host for a possessor is hard on the physical body. The body is only viable for 1 day per host creature hit dice before the body is “spent” and is discarded as a dead host.
Hive Mind (Ex) All possessors within a 100-mile range are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No possessor in a group is considered flanked unless all are flanked.
Psionic Blast (Su) Possessors may generate a psionic blast in a 30-ft. cone. All creatures within the cone must make a DC 13 Will save or be stunned for 3 rounds. The save is Charisma-based.
