SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hatred (Ex) A kithangian gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made against all creatures of the animal type. In addition, animals take a –2 penalty on all saving throws against a kithangian’s supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str plus nauseated; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Rasping Tongues (Su) The faces between a kithangian’s claws have long rasping tongues covered with tiny teeth.
Whenever a kithangian successfully grapples a foe with its claws, a rasping tongue slithers out from the face within and burrows into the creature’s body. Each round that the creature is grappled, it takes 1d6 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage as its sense of self-identity is warped and twisted. A successful DC 18 Will save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Swift Transformation (Su) A kithangian can use its change shape ability as a swift action.
