SPECIAL ABILITIES
Phrenic Disruption (Su) An enlightened contemplative using its thought form ability can disrupt the thoughts of a creature as an incorporeal touch attack. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will saving throw or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; multiple touches reset the duration but do not stack. At the start of a turn in which it is staggered by this ability, a creature must succeed at a second Will saving throw or take 1 point of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Psychic Buffer (Su) An enlightened contemplative generates a field of mental interference that absorbs hostile attacks. Whenever the enlightened contemplative would take hit point damage from a mind-affecting effect, it reduces the damage taken by 5.
In addition, it adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its Armor Class.
Thought Form (Su) As a move action, an enlightened contemplative can transform into a translucent figure of pure thought, during which time it is incorporeal and can use its phrenic disruption ability. It can remain in this form for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 9 rounds). If the effect ends while the enlightened contemplative is in a space it could not otherwise occupy, it takes 3d6 points of damage and is shunted to the nearest open space it could occupy.
