SPECIAL ABILITIES
Burst (Ex) A hydrus that has successfully invaded a creature will attempt to eat its way out, using its bite as a Tiny piercing weapon. It attacks from the inside each round (opponent’s Armor Class is equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature’s natural armor). It eats its way free after dealing 1/10 of the creature’s total hit points. Victims of a hydrus burst take an additional 1d6 bleed each round until they receive a DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing.
Invasive (Ex) A hydrus feeds by crawling inside a creature’s mouth and eating it from the inside. When a hydrus successfully hits an opponent, it may make an invasion combat maneuver as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It adds its size modifier to combat maneuver checks as a bonus rather than a penalty. Once it crawls in the creature’s mouth and down its throat, the hydrus gains the grappled condition. Once inside, the hydrus will try to eat its way out (see Burst). A hydrus can only invade creatures that are at least one size category larger than itself.
Poison (Ex) Spittle—contact; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 3 rounds; effect paralysis; cure 1 save. The poison spittle of a hydrus has a 10 ft. range increment and is otherwise considered a thrown weapon.
