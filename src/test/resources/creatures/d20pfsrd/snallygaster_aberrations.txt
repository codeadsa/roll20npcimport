SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aerial Charge (Ex) When a snallygaster charges downward at an angle of 45 degrees or more, its bite attack deals double damage (or triple damage on a critical hit). Bleed damage is not multiplied for this attack.
Sucking Tentacles (Ex) A snallygaster uses its retractable tentacles to suck blood from its victim’s bleeding wounds. If a target has a bleed effect and the snallygaster grabs it with tentacles or maintains a grapple against it, the target takes double the normal bleed damage at the beginning of its next turn. When the snallygaster is using its tentacles, it cannot make bite attacks.
