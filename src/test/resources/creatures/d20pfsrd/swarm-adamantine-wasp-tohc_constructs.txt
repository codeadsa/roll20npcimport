TACTICS
Adamantine wasps, being constructs, are non-intelligent and are programmed to carry out simple tasks such as “guard this room” or “attack any who enter here.” When following their commands, adamantine wasps fight until destroyed. A swarm attacks by stinging its foes and injecting its blood-freezing poison.
