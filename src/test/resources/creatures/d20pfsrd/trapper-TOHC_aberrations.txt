TACTICS
A trapper waits until its prey is almost centered on its body near the “trunk” or “chest” before it strikes. It then quickly folds and wraps its body around its unsuspecting prey attempting to smother and squeeze it until it is dead.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Smother (Ex) A trapper can try to wrap a creature up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The trapper attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
