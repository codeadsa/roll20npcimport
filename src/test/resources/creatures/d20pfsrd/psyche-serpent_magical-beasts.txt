SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hypnotic Hood (Su) A psyche serpent can use the hypnotism occult skill unlock to implant suggestions as a full-round action (instead of taking 1 minute) an unlimited number of times per day. While it hypnotizes its targets, it sways from side to side with the spiral pattern of its hood fully displayed. A successfully hypnotized victim can recall this spiral pattern but otherwise has no memory of the act of hypnotism unless the psyche serpent wishes it to.
Painless Bite (Ex) A psyche serpent’s venom has a powerful numbing effect, causing its bites to inflict no pain and allowing it to inject its poison without alerting its victims or awakening them from sleep. Even if the victim succeeded at its saving throw, it remains unaware it attempted a save against a psyche serpent’s venom.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wisdom, and a creature that takes Wisdom damage from this poison is considered a willing creature for the purposes of the psyche serpent’s hypnotism occult skill unlock until the Wisdom damage is healed; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC includes a +2 racial bonus.
