SPECIAL ABILITIES
Murmur (Su) A lorelei’s murmur has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it. This effect even influences undead creatures despite their usual immunity to mind-affecting effects. When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei’s song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poison (Ex) Tentacle—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Vortex (Su) A lorelei can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack, but can form only underwater and cannot leave the water. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be snared by the churning waters. The vortex is 20 feet across and 80 feet deep, and deals 2d8+9 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
