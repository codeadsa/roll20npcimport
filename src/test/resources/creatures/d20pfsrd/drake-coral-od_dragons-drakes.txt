SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Coral drakes nurture their offspring in specialized throat sacks. They can pressurize these sacks to spew forth a 15-ft. cone of its spawn. Any creatures in this area take 6d4 damage from thousands of tiny bites. In addition, all creatures in the area become nauseated for 1 round (Fort DC 19, Con-based). A coral drake can use its breath weapon every 1d4 rounds since the creature must siphon its young back into its throat sack before expelling them again.
Camouflage (Su) A coral drake’s coloration and shape lend to its stealth. For 10 rounds/day, a coral drake can shift its coloration, granting the benefit of 20% concealment These rounds need not be consecutive.
Poison (Ex) Coral drake venom: injury— bite; save DC 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Wis damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
