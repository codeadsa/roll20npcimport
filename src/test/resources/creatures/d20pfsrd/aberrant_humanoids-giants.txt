SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deformities (Ex) Aberrants possess an assortment of terrible deformities unique to each individual creature. When determining the deformities of a typical aberrant, roll randomly or choose 1d4–1 deformities from the Aberrant Deformities table. If two deformities are contradictory, reroll or select another. Racial bonuses gained from different deformities are cumulative.
For each deformity an aberrant possesses, it gains a –2 racial penalty on Charisma-based checks with non-aberrants except for Intimidate checks, where it instead gains a +2 racial bonus.
Table: Random Deformities d20 Deformity Effect
1 Toughened hide +4 bonus to natural armor
2 Extra arm May make one additional attack per round
3 Additional eyes +4 racial bonus on Perception checks
4 Unusually located eyes Gains all-around vision
5 Hunched back +4 racial bonus to avoid being tripped, bull rushed, or overrun
6 Strangely deformed head Can’t wear helmets or headgear unless magical or specifically designed for their head shape
7 Over-sized ears +4 racial bonus on Perception checks to hear noise
8 Over-sized nose Gains the scent ability
9 Huge feet or short legs Gains the trample ability (1d8+9, DC 20)
10 Elongated nails or claws Gains a claw attack with each arm, base 1d8 damage
11 Fangs or large mouth Gains a bite attack, base 2d4 damage
12 Tail Gains a tail slap secondary attack, base 2d6 damage
13 One or more pointed horns Gains a gore primary attack, base 1d10 damage
14 Large curled horns Can make a slam attack on a charge with its horns as a primary attack that does 2d6 base damage; if it hits, the aberrant can initiate a bull rush as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity
15 Long, gangly arms +5 ft. reach with attacks using its arms
16 Long, muscular legs +10 ft. to base land speed
17 Gills Can breathe underwater; gains swim speed equal to base land speed
18 Exudes foul odor Gains stench ability (DC 17, 10 rounds); other aberrants are immune to this effect
19 Venomous One or more of the aberrant’s natural attacks are poisonous; this could be poisonous claws, a tail sting, venomous fangs, or the like. Poison—injury; save Fort DC 17, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d4 to one physical ability score or 1d3 to one mental ability score, cure 2 consecutive saves.
20 Advanced deformity One of the aberrant’s other deformities is especially pronounced, gaining one of the following: an increase in base damage by one die type; Ability Focus as a bonus feat on the DC of the ability; or double the usual bonus the deformity provides
Oversized Weapon Fighting (Ex) The twisted bodies of aberrants allow them to wield weapons designed for Huge-sized creatures without penalty, as if they were Large-sized weapons.
Slow and Steady (Ex) Aberrants have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance.
