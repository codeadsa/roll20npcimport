SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deflective Wings (Ex) As a standard action, an angelic guardian can spread its wings and protect a single adjacent creature from the next ranged attack. The next time the protected creature would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged attack, the attack is instead deflected and the protected creature takes no damage. An angelic guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn in this way. This effect lasts until the angelic guardian’s next turn or until the protected creature leaves its square, whichever comes first.
Metallic Feathers (Ex) An angelic guardian’s wings are honed to razor-sharp edges, and attacks with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
