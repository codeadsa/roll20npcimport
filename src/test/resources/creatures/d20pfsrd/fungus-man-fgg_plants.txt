SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, a fungus man can release a cloud of noxious spores. All living creatures within 5 ft. must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect, and once a creature successfully saves it is immune to the spore cloud of that particular fungus man for 24 hours.
