Tactics Dlurgravens fighting lone prey prefer to make several quick strikes with Flyby Attack, keeping itself out of melee range for as long as possible until its poison takes effect. When fighting multiple foes they use a similar tactic, using their stunning stare ability to disable one opponent and give it time to concentrate on others.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Evasion (Ex) A dlurgraven can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If it makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.
Plane Shift (Sp) A dlurgraven may cast plane shift once per day as a full-round action. It may carry a single passenger of up to Medium-size. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name. The save DC is Charisma based.
Poison (Ex) The dlurgraven’s bite is poisonous.
Dlurgraven saliva Bite—injury; save Fort DC 13, frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1d2 Str, cure 1 save;
Stunning Stare (Su) Once per day a dlurgraven can direct a gaze attack at a single creature within 30 feet. The target is stunned for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 12).
