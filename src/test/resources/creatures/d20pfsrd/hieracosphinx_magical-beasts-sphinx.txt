SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shriek (Su) The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens non-sphinxes within a 60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC 16 Fort negates). Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the hieracosphinxâ€™s shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
