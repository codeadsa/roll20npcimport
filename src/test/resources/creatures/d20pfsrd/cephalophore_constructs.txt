SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dazing Gaze (Su) As a standard action, a cephalophore can hold up its severed head to make a gaze attack that affects all seeing creatures within a 60-foot radius. These creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.
Dazing Strike (Su) Any creature struck by the cephalophore’s slam attacks must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save against this affect are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.
Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon (magical or non-magical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon’s hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken condition.
Statue (Ex) If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.
