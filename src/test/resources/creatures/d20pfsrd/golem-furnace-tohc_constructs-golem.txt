SPECIAL ABILITIES
Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check. An opponent thrown into the furnace golem’s interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature’s interior requires a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem’s damage reduction applies to all attacks against the bars.
A Huge furnace golem’s interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.
Heat (Ex) A furnace golem’s entire form is extremely hot. Any slam attack deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with natural weapons take this same fire damage each time one of their attacks hits.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.
A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
