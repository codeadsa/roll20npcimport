SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a werecrocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, the werecrocodile deals its bite damage, knocks the creature prone, and maintains the grapple.
Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a werecrocodile can increase its land speed to 60 feet for 1 round.
