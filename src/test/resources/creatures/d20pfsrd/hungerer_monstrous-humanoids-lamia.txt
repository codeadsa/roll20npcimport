SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devastating Bite (Ex) A hungerer’s bite deals ×4 damage on a successful critical hit. If this damage is enough to reduce a victim to negative hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save to avoid being decapitated, bitten in half, or otherwise instantly killed by the horrific wound. The save DC is Strength-based.
Vile Spew (Su) Whenever a hungerer takes damage, the resulting wound spews a great gout of vile blood and acid. Any creature adjacent to a hungerer when it is wounded takes 2d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 25 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Wisdom Drain (Su) A hungerer drains 2 points of Wisdom each time it strikes a foe with its bite or claw attacks. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a hungerer does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.
