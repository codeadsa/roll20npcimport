SPECIAL ABILITIES
Multispell (Ex) An arach spellcaster (one that has taken levels in a spellcasting class) can cast multiple spells in a given round. If each spell is 3rd-level or less, an arach can cast up to three spells per round; 4th- or 5th-level spells, two per round. An arach cannot multispell spells higher than 5th-level.
Poison (Ex) Arach Venom: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 1 save. An arach can also coat a single weapon it wields with this poison as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spider Passivism (Ex) No spiders, monstrous spiders, phase spiders, temporal crawlers, sand stalkers, arachnid werecreatures (such as werespiders) or other spider-like creatures with an Intelligence of 8 or less willingly attack an arach. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If the arach or one of its allies attacks the creature first, this passivism is negated for that creature for 24 hours.
