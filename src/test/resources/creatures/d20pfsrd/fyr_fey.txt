SPECIAL ABILITIES
Weapon Attunement (Su) Fyrs have a mystical ability to attune themselves with any weapon they wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a masterwork item (gaining a +1 bonus to attack rolls) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does not stack with the enhancement bonus gained from magical weapons, or the bonus gained from a masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the statistics block above.
