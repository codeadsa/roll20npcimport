SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bog Rot (Su) Supernatural disease—slam; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d6 Str, Dex, Con, or Cha (determine randomly using 1d4); cure —.
Creatures afflicted with bog rot do not heal naturally and gain only one-half benefit from magical healing until the disease is cured. Unlike normal diseases, bog rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid that dies from bog rot becomes a bog mummy in 1d4 days unless a remove disease is cast (within one day after death) or the creature is brought back to life (raise dead is ineffective, but resurrection or true resurrection works). Spawn are under the command of the bog mummy that created them and remain enslaved until their death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-feet radius that see a bog mummy must make a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same bog mummy’s despair ability for one day. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Marsh Move (Ex) Bog mummies can move at their normal movement speed through mud, marshes, and swamps with no penalty.
