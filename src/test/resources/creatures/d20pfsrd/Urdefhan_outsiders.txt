SQ daemonic pact
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Daemonic Pact (Su) Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate action, an urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a 5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex half). The save DC is Con-based.
Strength Damage (Su) An urdefhan’s bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent until the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.
