SPECIAL ABILITIES
Absorb Body (Su) A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least 1 full round. An unconscious or dying opponent can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption. A dead opponent gets no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered.
All-Around Vision (Ex) A fiery corpse orgy sees in all directions at once. It can not be flanked.
Pain Shriek (Su) Twice per day as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing shriek from the various heads captured in its form. This shriek deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in a 40-foot radius (Fortitude DC 22 for half). Creatures that cannot hear do not take this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
