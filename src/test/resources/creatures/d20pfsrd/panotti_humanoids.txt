SPECIAL ABILITIES
Elephantine Ears (Ex) A panotti can flap its huge ears to fly awkwardly. A panotti can also wrap its ears around the length of its body for warmth and protection from the elements (similar to using a bedroll or heavy blankets), or use them as secondary natural attacks (as per wing attacks).
Panotti in Mythology
The panotti are cryptids drawn from real-world mythology, specifically Natural History by Pliny the Elder in 77–79 a.d. They are also counted among the strange creatures living in the legendary kingdom of Prester John, along with the blemmyae, cynocephali (protowerewolves), and monopods.
