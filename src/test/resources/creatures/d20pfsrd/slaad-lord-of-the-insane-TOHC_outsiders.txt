SPECIAL ABILITIES
Energy Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by the Slaad Lord’s slam attack gain 3 negative levels. The DC is 45 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The DC is Constitution-based.
Amorphous (Ex) The Slaad Lord of the Insane is not subject to critical hits, and having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.
Change Shape (Su) The Slaad Lord of the Insane can assume the shape of a humanoid as a standard action. In humanoid form, the slaad lord cannot use its natural weapons and does not deal negative levels. He usually assumes as a human male fighter cloaked in black plate armor wielding an iron black longsword (purportedly the legendary Black Sword: a +3 cold iron longsword that stuns any creature struck, as if by a power word stun spell, for 1d10 minutes if the victim fails a DC 24 Fortitude save).
