SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hungry Gaze (Su) The monarch worms gaze attack deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage plus fatigue at a distance of 120 feet. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save negates the fatigue. Creatures already fatigued become exhausted; creatures already exhausted become staggered. A creature that fails its save must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or gain an overwhelming compulsion to eat flesh of creatures of its type, including its own if no other is available. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spines (Ex) Creatures striking it with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, melee weapons, or melee touch attacks take 2d6+12 points of damage.
