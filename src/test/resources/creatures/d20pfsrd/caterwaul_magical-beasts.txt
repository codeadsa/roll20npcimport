SPECIAL ABILITIES
Evasion (Ex) This functions identically to the rogue ability.
Screech (Su) Once every 10 minutes, a caterwaul can emit a piercing screech that deals 1d8 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature that makes a successful DC 16 Fortitude save takes no damage. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a caterwaul can move four times its normal speed (200 feet) when it makes a charge.
