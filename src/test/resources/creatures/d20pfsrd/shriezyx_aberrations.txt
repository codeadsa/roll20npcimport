SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fear of Fire (Ex) A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
Slowing Toxin (Su) A shriezyx’s web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx’s web must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs—it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs remain sticky and tangled, but do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
