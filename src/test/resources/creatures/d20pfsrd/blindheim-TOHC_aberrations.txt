SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eye Beams (Ex) When a blindheim’s eyes are open, it emits a 30-foot cone of light. It can see normally in this light and functions normally in areas of darkness (but not deeper darkness). A creature looking at a blindheim when its eye beams are “on” must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour. A successful save renders the creature immune to the same blindheim’s eye beams for 24 hours. The blindness can be cured by remove blindness or more powerful magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.
