SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electricity Aura (Su) An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon’s turn. An ancient dragon’s aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm’s damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.
Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
Vortex (Ex) Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an elder water elemental. A bronze dragon can maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.
Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.
Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.
