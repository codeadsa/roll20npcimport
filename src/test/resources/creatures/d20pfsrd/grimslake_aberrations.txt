SPECIAL ABILITIES
Marrow Drain (Ex) A grimslake’s tail is covered with suckers that extend long, thin, razor-sharp tendrils to drill into its victim’s bones, draining them of marrow. As a swift action, a grimslake can drain marrow from a creature it is grappling or from a helpless creature. The victim can resist this painful attack with a successful DC 18 Fortitude save; otherwise, the creature becomes staggered from the horrific agony for 1 round and takes 1 point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Penetrating Jaws (Su) A grimslake’s bite attack penetrates cold iron and silver damage reduction.
Slashing Scales (Ex) The scales running in a line down a grimslake’s back have razor-sharp ridges and spines, and the creature is adept at lashing at attackers with these scales. Any creature that attacks a grimslake with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or light weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d4 points of slashing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
