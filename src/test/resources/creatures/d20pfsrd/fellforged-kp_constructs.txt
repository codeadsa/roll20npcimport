SPECIAL ABILITIES
Exorcism Sensitivity (Ex) While the body the fellforged inhabits was constructed to specially bind spirits, the foul presence of the wraith within is not invulnerable from particularly strong clerics. The fellforged is considered a 5 HD undead creature versus any channeled turn attempts, and the clockwork body shields the captured spirit somewhat, granting it +4 channel resistance. Any successful turn attempt exorcises the wraith from its clockwork frame, but the creature is not bound by any further turn results, even destruction, from this initial attempt. As the clockwork body collapses lifelessly to the ground, the creature is now treated as a wraith of the normal type in all respects and may be subject to further turn attempts. The wraith retains its current hp total.
Unnatural Aura (Su) All animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of fellforged at a distance of 30 ft. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so, and they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.
Violent Escapement (Ex) With little regard for the clockwork bodies they inhabit, fellforged wraiths can stress and strain their mechanisms in such a violent manner that flywheels unwind, gears shatter, and springs snap. As a move action 1/round, this violent burst of gears and pulleys can deal 2d6 damage to all adjacent foes (Reflex DC 15 for half; Cha-based). Each use of this ability imposes a cumulative -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws, and reduces movement by 5 ft. If its speed is reduced to 0 ft. in this manner, the fellforged becomes immobile and helpless until repaired. Repairing a fellforged requires a DC 16 Craft (gearsmithing) check and the expenditure of replacement parts worth 100 gp.
