SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sleep (Su) A creature struck by a sandman must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as though by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures attacking a sandman unarmed or with natural attacks are also subject to this special attack.
Sleep Aura (Su) A sandman can radiate a 20-foot-radius sleep aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as though by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sandmanâ€™s sleep aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Protection from Arrows (Su) A sandman is protected by a permanent protection from arrows effect (as the spell) that grants it damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. This ability is inherent and cannot be dispelled.
