SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Ex) A glacial ooze’s form is extremely cold, dealing 1d6 cold damage with its slam attack. Creatures attacking a glacial ooze unarmed or with natural weapons take this cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
Freezing Embrace (Ex) As a free action, a glacial ooze can encase an engulfed opponent in ice. A frozen creature takes 2d4 points of cold damage each round. A frozen creature can break free of the ice by making a successful DC 19 Strength check. The ice is AC 10, hardness 0, and has 10 hit points per 5-foot section. A frozen creature cannot use a weapon to break free even if it was holding it when it was frozen. Spells with verbal, material, or somatic components cannot be cast by a creature encased in ice. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
Transparent (Ex) A glacial ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a glacial ooze and walk into it are automatically engulfed.
