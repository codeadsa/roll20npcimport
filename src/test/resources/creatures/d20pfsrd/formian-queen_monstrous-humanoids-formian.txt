SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hive Frenzy (Su) Once per day as a standard action, the queen can send out a command to all formians within range of her telepathy. Those formians are affected as if by a haste spell (CL 20th).
Telepathic Feedback (Su) As a standard action, a queen can unleash debilitating telepathic feedback. Those within her telepathic range who are not members of her hive must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds at the save cannot be affected by telepathic feedback for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
