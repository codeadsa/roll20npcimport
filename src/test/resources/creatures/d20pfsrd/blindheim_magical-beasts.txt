SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blinding Gaze (Ex) A blindheimâ€™s eyes emit bright light to a range of 30 feet. Any creature within the area must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour. Blindheims can see normally in the light generated by their eyes, which illuminates a 30-foot spread with bright light. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take the normal penalties within 30 feet of a blindheim that is using its blinding gaze. A blindheim can activate or suppress this ability as a free action. This save DC is Constitution-based.
