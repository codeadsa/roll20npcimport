SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) The bog scum secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers damage from a bog scum’s acid, the creature’s clothing and armor takes an equal amount of damage from the acid. A DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes the bog scum takes 2d8 acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 25 Reflex save. If the bog scum remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 25 points of acid damage (no save) to the object.
The acid DCs are Constitution-based. The acid damage is not doubled with a successful Vital Strike.
Sticky (Ex) Bog scum is extremely sticky and difficult to get away from. The bog scum gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.
