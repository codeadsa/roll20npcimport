SPECIAL ABILITIES
Destructive Attacks (Ex) An abrikandilu’s natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits against objects. In addition, an abrikandilu gains a +5 racial bonus on Strength checks to break or destroy objects.
Hatred of Mirrors (Ex) An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature (at the GM’s discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.
Mutilation (Su) An abrikandilu’s bite causes horrific and hideous wounds that not only mar beauty but supernaturally diminish a creature’s sense of self-worth. A creature bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a –1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty stacks, up to a –5 penalty, and it lasts even after the wounds are healed. The penalty slowly fades with time, diminishing by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0.
This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
