SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Wisdom damage; cure 3 saves.
Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid’s wild empathy, save that it works only on spiders. A jorogumo gains a racial bonus on this check equal to her Hit Dice (normally +14). Spiders are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the jorogumo to train them and use them as guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats).
Spider Legs (Ex) A jorogumo’s spider legs can emerge or retract as a free action. When a jorogumo’s spider legs are present, she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.
Swift Shapechanger (Ex) A jorogumo can assume spider or human form as a swift action.
