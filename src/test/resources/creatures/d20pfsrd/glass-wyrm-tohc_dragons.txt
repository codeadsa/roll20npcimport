SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A glass wyrm’s breath weapon is a 40 ft. cone of razor-sharp shards of glass.
Reflective Hide (Ex) Any mundane or magical light source brought within 30 feet of a glass wyrm causes the light to be reflected as a burst that blinds all creatures within 30 feet for 1d6+4 rounds. A creature can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save to negate the blinding effect. This otherwise operates like a gaze attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spell Reflection (Ex) Any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and targets a glass wyrm (or includes it in its area of effect) is reflected back on the caster if the glass wyrm successfully resists the spell or effect. The original caster becomes the spell’s target (or its point of origin in the case of area spells). A reflected spell can be resisted normally by the caster (and any other creatures affected). A glass wyrm cannot reflect a sonic-based spell or spell-like ability, even if it allows resistance.
