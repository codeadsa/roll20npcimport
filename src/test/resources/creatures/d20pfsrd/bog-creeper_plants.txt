SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Spray (Ex) Three times per day, a bog creeper can spew digestive acid from its mouth in a 30–foot cone that deals 2d8 points of acid damage to all creatures in the area, with a DC 20 Reflex save allowed for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Camouflage (Ex) Since a bog creeper looks like a plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.
Marsh Move (Ex) A bog creeper can move across marshy terrain without incurring any movement penalties.
