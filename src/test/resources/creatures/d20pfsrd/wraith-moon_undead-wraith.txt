SPECIAL ABILITIES
Body of Darkness (Ex) In areas of darkness, the moon wraith can assume a corporeal form as a move action. The moon wraith’s body of darkness appears as a humanoid with a pair of boney claws, swaddled in black rags wearing a white clay mask. In this form, it loses the incorporeal subtype, its fly speed, and its incorporeal touch attack, but gains a +5 natural armor bonus (total AC 19), a speed of 30 feet, 2 claws (+11, 1d8+5 plus 1d6 Con drain), and a Strength score of 20. The moon wraith may resume its normal incorporeal form as a swift action, and automatically becomes incorporeal again should the level of illumination increase to dim light or brighter.
Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by a moon wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a –2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive –2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the moon wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Constitution Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a wraith’s touch attack (or claw attacks in corporeal form, see body of darkness above) must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. This is a negative energy effect. On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Lifesense (Su) A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
Light Discorporation (Ex) In areas of bright or normal light, the moon wraith cannot attack, becomes ethereal (as per the ethereal jaunt spell), and is staggered.
Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
