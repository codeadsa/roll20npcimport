TACTICS
This undead vargouille is but a shadow of its former self—it has lost its deadly kiss, shriek, and poison, and its wings are tattered ribbons, barely able to hold its rotting head aloft, but its teeth remain razor sharp. The flapping head turns to attack any living creatures it sees, slamming into and biting its foes. The flapping head fights until destroyed.
