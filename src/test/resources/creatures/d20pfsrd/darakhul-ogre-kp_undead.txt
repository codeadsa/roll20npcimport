SPECIAL ABILITIES
Daylight Weakness (Ex) A darakhul suffers a -4 penalty to attack and saving throws when in full daylight. A daylight spell instead inflicts a -2 penalty to a darakhul.
Disease (Su) Darakhul fever: bite—injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier; onset 1 day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
A creature that dies while infected with darakhul fever must make an adjustment check (see sidebar). If its check is high enough, it rises as a darakhul rather than as a standard ghoul within an hour. A darakhul is a free-willed undead. A creature that rises as a standard ghoul or ghast is controlled by the darakhul whose fever infected it.
Paralysis (Ex) Those hit by a darakhul’s natural weapons must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Charisma ability modifier) or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to this paralysis.
