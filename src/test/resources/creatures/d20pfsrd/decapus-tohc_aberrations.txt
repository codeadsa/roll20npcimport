SPECIAL ABILITIES
Brachiation (Ex) A decapus can move through trees at its base climb speed (30 feet per round) by using its tentacles to swing from tree to tree. Trees used by the decapus in this manner can be no further than 10 feet apart.
Sound Imitation (Ex) A decapus can mimic any creature it has previously encountered with near total accuracy, though it cannot mimic humanoid speech longer than two or three words at a time. A DC 13 Will save detects the ruse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
