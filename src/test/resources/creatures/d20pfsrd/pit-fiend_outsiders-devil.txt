SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devil Shaping (Su) Three times per day, a pit fiend can spend a minute to transform nearby lemures into other lesser devils. A pit fiend can transform one lemure for every Hit Die the pit fiend possesses. It can then reshape these lemures into a number of Hit Dice‘s worth of lesser devils equal to the number of lemures affected. For example, a typical 20 Hit Dice pit fiend could transform 20 lemures into two bone devils (10 HD each), or three bearded devils (6 HD each, leaving two lemures unchanged), or any other combination of lesser devils. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend. Although pit fiends can, technically, elevate a mass of 20 lemures into a new pit fiend, most are hesitant to do so since they have no special control over a devil created in this manner.
Disease (Su) Devil Chills: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 32; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Infernal Dukes The most powerful of pit fiends are lords in their own right—members of the elite caste of infernal politics and leadership known as the Dukes of Hell. While not all of the Dukes of Hell are pit fiends, the majority of them are. As a general rule, a pit fiend Duke of Hell has several levels of a particular character class, the advanced simple template, or in some cases unusual spell-like abilities or unique powers over and above those of most pit fiends. Listed here are three sample unique pit fiend duke abilities, but these examples are by no means the entirety of what strange powers an infernal duke might wield.
Deathmastery (Su) The pit fiend duke’s ability to manipulate the souls of the damned extends beyond the standard devil shaping power. Whenever a pit fiend slays a humanoid, it can attempt to transform the slain creature’s soul into a ghost under the pit fiend’s control. The pit fiend may control a number of ghosts in this manner equal to its Charisma modifier.
Master of Magic (Su) The pit fiend duke has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels’ worth of 1st–4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels’ worth of 5th–8th level spells usable 3 times a day).
Hellfire Breath (Su) The pit fiend gains a devastating breath weapon that it can use once every 1d4 rounds. This breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire (10d10 fire damage and 10d10 unholy damage as per flame strike, successful Reflex save [DC 10 + 1/2 the pit fiend’s racial HD + the pit fiend’s Constitution modifier] half).

Infernal Sacrifices Nothing but the most blasphemous of offerings can tempt a pit fiend to service. Only the sacrifice of a powerful good-aligned cleric or noteworthy angel, the destruction of a significant holy relic, or the offering of a powerful tool of evil might aid a summoner in coaxing a pit fiend from the infernal realm. Any such sacrifice grants the summoner a +2 Charisma bonus on checks made to summon such lords of devilkind.
