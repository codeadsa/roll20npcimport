SPECIAL ABILITIES
Envelop (Ex) A skinwraith can wrap around its foe completely. If the skinwraith starts the round grappling a creature it may make a CMB check to envelop the creature it is grappling and deal 1d6+1 points of bludgeoning damage to the creature. Enveloped opponents gain the pinned condition, and are trapped within the skinwraith’s body until they are no longer pinned. Each round, if the skinwraith succeeds on the check to maintain the pin, it deals 1d6+1 bludgeoning damage to the enveloped opponents and may additionally make attacks against adjacent creatures, treating its natural weapons as secondary (2 lashes +0 [1d4]). While its opponent is pinned, any attacks striking the skinwraith deal damage to both the skinwraith and its victim; each receives half the damage before damage reduction, rounded down.
