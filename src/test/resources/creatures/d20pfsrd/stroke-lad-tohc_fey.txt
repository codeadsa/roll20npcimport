TACTICS
Stroke lads are vicious in their disdain for mortals, especially humans, and even more particularly, mortals more attractive than themselves. They attack with their long fingers, attempting to wither the arms or legs of foes in order to make them lame, or better yet, to permanently disfiguring the faces of those more handsome than themselves.
Morale Cowards at heart, they surrender if threatened with death and attempt to negotiate their way out of danger to themselves. Of course they never keep to a bargain and should not be trusted.
