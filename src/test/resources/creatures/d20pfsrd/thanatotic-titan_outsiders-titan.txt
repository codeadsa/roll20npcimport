SPECIAL ABILITIES
Godslayer (Su) When a thanatotic titan damages a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must make a DC 28 Will save or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1d4 rounds and be shaken. If the save is successful, the creature struck is merely shaken for 1 round. A thanatotic titan’s attacks are treated as epic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The save DC is Charisma-based.
