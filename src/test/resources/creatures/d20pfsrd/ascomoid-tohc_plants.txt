SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spores (Ex) Once per round, an ascomoid can fire deadly spores in a 30-foot line. Upon impacting a solid surface, the spores billow into a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius. The cloud lasts 1 round before dispersing. Creatures caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the nauseated condition. Once a creature saves against this ability it is immune to the same ascomoid’s spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
