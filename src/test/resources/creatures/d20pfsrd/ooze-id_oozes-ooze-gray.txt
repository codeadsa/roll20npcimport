SPECIAL ABILITIES Acid (Ex)
The digestive acid that covers an ooze dissolves metals and organic material, but not stone. Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by an ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes an ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze’s touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Transparent (Ex)
Due to its lack of vivid coloration, an ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice the ooze. Any creature that fails to notice an ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the ooze’s slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the ooze.
Communication (Ex)
Id oozes can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes within 100 feet via telepathy
