SPECIAL ABILITIES
Astral Jaunt (Su) A corpsespinner can shift from the Astral Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th) except it accesses the Astral Plane.
Astralsense (Su) A corpsespinner can automatically detect the location of anything within 200 feet of it on the Astral Plane.
Create Corpsespun (Su) Creatures slain by a corpsespinner but not devoured rise in 1 hour as a corpsespun creature.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 2d6 Intelligence damage, death at 0 Intelligence and rise as a corpsespun after 1 hour; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Web (Ex) As the standard ability but with range 80 ft. In addition the checks include both a +4 bonus because the webs are constructed of astral material and a +4 racial bonus. The corpsespinner cannot produce the magical astral webs during combat.
