SPECIAL ABILITIES
Guarded (Su) A lampad adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her armor class.
Insane Beauty (Su) This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet who are viewing a lampad in conditions brighter than dim light. Those who look directly upon the lampad must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or gain the confused condition for 1d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the same lampad’s insane beauty for 24 hours. A lampad can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spells A lampad casts spells as a 5th-level druid, but can’t swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.
Weep (Su) As a standard action, a lampad can unsettle those near her when she cries. Any creature within 30 feet who can hear a lampad weeping becomes shaken unless it succeeds at a DC 18 Will saving throw. This ability can’t cause a creature to become frightened or panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components. The save DC is Charisma-based.
