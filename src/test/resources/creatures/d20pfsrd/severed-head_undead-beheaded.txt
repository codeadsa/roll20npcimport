SPECIAL ABILITIES
Beheaded can be created with any of the following special abilities. For every two abilities the beheaded possesses, increase the beheaded’s CR by +1 (except swarming which counts as 2 abilities by itself.)
Belching (Su) The beheaded can make a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen at the time of creation).
Flaming (Su) The beheaded gains fire immunity and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Its slam attack also deals 1d6 points of fire damage and might catch the target on fire.
Grabbing (Ex) The beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair or other limblike growths (such as a medusa’s snake hair). Its slam attack gains the grab (Medium) special ability.
Screaming (Su) The beheaded can scream out once every 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull’s racial Hit Dice + the screaming skull’s Charisma modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, any creature in the area can’t be affected by that beheaded’s scream for the next 24 hours.
Swarming (Ex) The beheaded gains 1 additional Hit Die, the swarm subtype, swarm immunities, and the distraction special ability. It loses its slam attack but gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This counts as two abilities for the purpose of determining the beheaded’s CR.
