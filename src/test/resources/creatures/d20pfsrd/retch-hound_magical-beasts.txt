TACTICS
Retch hounds hunt their prey in packs. Using an eerie howl, they seem to coordinate and communicate with one another during these hunts. A favored tactic of a retch hound pack is to encircle a foe and then hit it from all sides at once. Usually the largest hound in the pack is the leader. When slain, a retch hound melts into a pile of stinking and bubbling slime.
