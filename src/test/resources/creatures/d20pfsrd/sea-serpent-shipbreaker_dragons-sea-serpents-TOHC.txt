SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A shipbreaker sea serpent can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the sea serpent’s size, the sea serpent takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Poison (Ex) Bite–injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
