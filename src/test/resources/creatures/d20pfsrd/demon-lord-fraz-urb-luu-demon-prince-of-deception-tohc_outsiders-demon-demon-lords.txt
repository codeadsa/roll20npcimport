TACTICS
Fraz-Urb’luu opens combat by pounding his foes with his spells or spell-like abilities. He next assaults them physically by pummeling with his powerful fists and slashing with his tail. A grabbed foe is entwined in his tail and gnashed between the demon prince’s fangs. One of Fraz-Urb’luu’s favorite tactics, after wearing down his opponents, is to summon a demon prince and then immediately teleport away as the prince arrives.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Summon Demonic Entity (Sp) Once per day, Fraz-Urb’luu can attempt to summon a demon lord or demon prince with a 70% chance of success, and deceive the summoned demon into believing it was called by his opponents. The summoned lord or prince must succeed on a DC 44 Will save. If the save fails, it believes that Fraz-Urb’luu’s opponents called it and deals with them appropriately (which usually involves killing the offending party for daring to call a demon prince or lord). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +15 racial bonus. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.
