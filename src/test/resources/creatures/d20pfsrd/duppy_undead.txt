SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ravenous Hounds (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, a duppy can bring into being a pack of incorporeal hounds for 1d4+3 rounds. The ravenous hounds attack as a single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20.
This ability is otherwise identical to mage’s sword (CL 7th).
Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) Raise dead or a similar spell cast on a duppy destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
Strength Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a duppy’s touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. If the target fails its save, the duppy also gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
