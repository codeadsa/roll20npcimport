SPECIAL ABILITIES
Size Alteration (Su) At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size between Small and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan’s person grow proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, –2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution, and he takes a –2 size penalty to his AC. While Large, a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities (although if he possesses either from class levels or templates, he retains their use in both sizes).
Spriggan Magic (Ex) A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks and to save DCs for all of its racial spell-like abilities.
Spriggan Skills (Ex) Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class skills for spriggans.
