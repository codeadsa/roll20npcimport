SPECIAL ABILITIES

This power can only affect creatures with a challenge rating of 2 levels less than the taskmaster formian. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
