TACTICS
Blood reavers despise mortals and attack them on sight. They prefer to hide or stand nearby while invisible and let their siphoning aura drain a person of its blood, though the telltale sign that something is wrong is when the victim’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth begin to bleed for no apparent reason.
In combat, they attack with their barbed flails, relentlessly hammering away at their enemies and freely unloading with walls of fire to separate allies from one another. Being immune to fire, the blood reaver simply walks through the wall and attacks the creature standing on the other side.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Siphoning Aura (Su) Blood reavers can radiate an aura in a 20-foot radius as a free action that causes a creature to bleed from its mouth, nose, eyes, and ears. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round or take 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Stun (Su) Whenever a blood reaver hits with a dire flail attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the blood reaver, not the dire flail.
