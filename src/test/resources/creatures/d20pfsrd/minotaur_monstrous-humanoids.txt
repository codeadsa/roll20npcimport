TACTICS
Before Combat Minotaurs prefer to lure their prey into confusing terrain, such as a maze, sewer, or tunnel system, before setting up an ambush. If possible, they stalk their prey for days before finally committing to battle.
During Combat Minotaurs typically begin combat by charging the most threatening opponent. They follow this up with devastating swings of their greataxes, using Power Attack if they are hitting easily.
Morale Out in the open, a minotaur attempts to flee from combat if reduced to 10 hp. If in a maze or other controlled territory, most minotaurs fight to the death.
