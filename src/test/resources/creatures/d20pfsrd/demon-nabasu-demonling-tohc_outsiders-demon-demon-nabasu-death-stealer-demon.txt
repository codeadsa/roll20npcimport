SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Gaze (Su) Once per day per growth point (minimum 1/day for a demonling, 10/day for a mature nabasu), a nabasu can use its death gaze for a full round. Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed.
Feed (Su) When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check—success indicates it becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically becomes a mature nabasu.
Plane Shift (Su) Three times per day a nabasu demonling can shift to the Material Plane, and a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature nabasu).
