SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sucking Maws (Su) A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is grappling automatically inflicts 1d4 points of Strength drain on that creature. A DC 24 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point of Strength drain. A creature drained to 0 Strength does not die, but must make a DC 24 Will save at that point to resist being driven mad by the experience, as the foul green waste exuded from the same sucking mouths that drink life implant in the emptied shells strange visions and horrifying certainties. This madness manifests as schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the dark young’s Strength drain save DC listed above (DC 24 for most dark young). One common result of this unfortunate madness is a strange desire to return to the site of their original encounter in hopes of being consumed entirely by the creature that only drank a part of their body and mind—many of those who survive this horrific ordeal go on to found dark young cults of their own. The madness element of a dark young’s sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for all of the saving throws involved with this special ability is Constitution-based.
