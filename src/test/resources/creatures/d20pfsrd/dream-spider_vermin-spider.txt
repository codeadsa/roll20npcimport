TACTICS
Dream spiders try to lure opponents into their webbing before moving in to bite them. Opponents who become senseless due to Wisdom loss are often wrapped in webbing to ensure they do not recover and are slowly devoured.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dream Web (Ex) A dream spider can spin webs just like a monstrous spider of the same size but its webs carry an iridescent hue, making them easy to notice (Spot DC 15). Any animal, humanoid, giant, or monstrous humanoid that comes in contact with these webs experiences strange hallucinations, taking 1 point of Wisdom damage per round of contact. A DC 11 Fortitude save negates this damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they create a spread of poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to all creatures in the area (not just to those susceptible to contact with webs as listed above). A DC 11 Fortitude save halves this damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for only a single round before dissipating harmlessly. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Dream Spider Poison (Ex) Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 11
Frequency 1/round for 5 rounds
Effect 1d2 Wis damage; Cure 2 saves
