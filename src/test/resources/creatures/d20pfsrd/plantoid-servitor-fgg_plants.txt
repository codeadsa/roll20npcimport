SPECIAL ABILITIES
Grab and Bite (Ex) A plantoid servitor that succeeds on a grapple check can make a bite attack against its opponent as an immediate action. This attack uses the plantoid servitor’s full attack bonus and deals 1d3+2 damage.
Poison (Ex) Transformative Poison: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect special; cure 1 save.
On the first failed save, the victim is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. On the second failed saving throw, moss rapidly grows on all skin surfaces. The victim gets a +2 bonus on the third saving throw, but if the third save fails the victim becomes a plantoid servitor under the control of the nearest plantoid. There is a 25% chance that the victim becomes a new plantoid in a hideous transformation that takes 24 hours. If the victim succeeds on his third saving throw, the moss that grew on him withers and dies and falls away within a few minutes.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
