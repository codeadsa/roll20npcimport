SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Evil (Su) A grimm constantly exudes an aura of evil around its form. This aura deals 2d6 points of profane damage to all creatures in any space adjacent to the grimm. Evil creatures do not take this damage.
Blur (Su) As a move action, a grimm can blur its form (as the spell of the same name). This grants it concealment (20% miss chance).
Devour (Su) If a grimm pins a grappled creature, it deals 1d6 points of Strength drain each round the pin is maintained. Each time the grimm drains Strength, it gains a +1 bonus to its Strength score. These bonus points are temporary and the grimm loses them at the rate of 1 per hour.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A grimm can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action and shift back again as a free action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 3 rounds before returning to the Material Plane. The ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name (caster level 20th).
Fey Spell Resistance (Ex) Against fey magic (spells or spell-like abilities used by any fey creature including elves) a grimm’s spell resistance is 28.
