SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frightful Presence (Ex) When a beast of chaos growls, roars, hisses, or makes any other sound common to its animal type, all creatures within 30 feet that hear it and those with fewer HD than the beast of chaos must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the beast of chaos’ HD + the beast of chaos’ Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 5d6 rounds.
Rage (Ex) In the presence of bright light (a daylight spell, continual flame, but not actual sunlight), a beast of chaos flies into a berserk rage, attacking until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and –4 AC while enraged. It cannot end its rage voluntarily. If the source of light is removed, the creature’s rage ends 1d4 rounds later. The beast is fatigued (–2 to Strength and Dexterity) for the remainder of the encounter.
