About this Daemon Type… Preferring to disguise themselves as mortals or other creatures, vulnudaemons rarely assume their true forms unless they are forced to do so or are in the presence of a greater daemon. When they do, they appear as partially coalescent clouds of bloody mist in the form of a ghostly, cloaked figure, perpetually dripping and reabsorbing a crimson trail. In Abaddon, they often pose as the hunted, hiding among them and killing them one by one, escalating the violence each time. On the Material Plane, vulnudaemons also dwell among their prey, insinuating themselves into settlements as traders or other mundane member of society. From there, the deaths spread. Such killing sprees are exceptional difficult to combat, as vulnudaemons frequently switch personae, adopting the lives and covers of their victims, confounding investigations before vanishing without a trace, leaving only fear and rumors in their wake.
Personification of Death: Murder.
Preferred Sacrifice: A bound and helpless intelligent creature for the vulnudaemon to kill and impersonate.
