SPECIAL ABILITIES
Surgical Strikes (Ex) An interlocutor’s claws threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. On a successful critical hit, that claw deals 2d6 bleed damage rather than 1d6.
Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an eremite’s unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round as it becomes convinced that it recognizes some of its own body parts entangled in the interlocutor’s body.
