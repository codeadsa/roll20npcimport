SPECIAL ABILITIES
Invisibility (Su) A foo creature can become invisible at will. This ability functions as the spell of the same name with a caster level equal to the foo creature’s HD + 3.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A foo creature can shift from the Ethereal to the Material Plane as a free action and shift back again as a move action. The ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.
Plane Shift (Sp) A foo creature can enter the Astral Plane or the Material Plane. This ability transports the foo creature and up to eight other creatures, provided they are all within 5 feet of the foo creature. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.

Strike Evil (Su) Foo creatures have a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls when fighting evil-aligned creatures. This ability is always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.
Summon Foo Creatures (Sp) Once per day, by barking, roaring, or making any other sound common to its type, a foo creature can summon 1d4 additional foo creatures of its same type with a 25% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
