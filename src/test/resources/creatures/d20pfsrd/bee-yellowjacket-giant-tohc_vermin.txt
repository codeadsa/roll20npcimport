TACTICS
Giant yellowjackets attack by biting their foes. Though it has a poisonous stinger, it usually conducts combat with its bite attack, unless threatened by or confronting a particularly powerful opponent. In such cases, the giant yellowjacket brings its stinger to bear and repeatedly stings its foes until they are dead. If attacked, a giant yellowjacket releases a pheromone that agitates all others of its kind, making them deadlier and more aggressive.
