SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chained Daggers (Su) A crucidaemon fights with the two daggers chained to its wrists as if dual wielding daggers with a reach of 10 feet (although it can also attack adjacent foes with no penalty). It takes no penalty on attack or damage rolls while wielding both of these daggers at once. These daggers are considered to be +2 daggers that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. The daggers become nonmagical upon the daemon’s death, and cannot be disarmed. A crucidaemon may remanifest a destroyed dagger as a standard action.
Trap Making (Ex) A crucidaemon can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. When it uses its greater glyph of warding spell-like ability to create a spell glyph, it may utilize any 6th-level or lower spell from the cleric or the wizard spell list, even though it otherwise can’t cast these spells. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for any traps a crucidaemon creates gain a +2 bonus.
About this Daemon Type… Crucidaemons kill their victims via traps and torture devices. On Abaddon, they often find service as interrogators and authorities in daemonic cities, their cunning minds predisposing them to elaborate, sadistic plots. Conjurers often bind crucidaemons to serve as guardians and design defenses, which typically take the form of warrens filled with complex, nightmarish traps. Crucidaemons take excessive pride in their creations, viewing themselves as maestros of murderous engineering, and considering every new trap a composition and every victim an audience. Those who manage to escape the daemons’ traps frustrate crucidaemons to no end, becoming the fiends’ most prized quarries. Once released from service or given the freedom to pursue, these daemons obsessively hunt down any escapees, engineering new, more elaborate, and more excruciating traps to take revenge upon those who slighted their work.
Personification of Death: Torture and traps.
Preferred Sacrifice: A unique trap or torture device, or the blueprints for one.
