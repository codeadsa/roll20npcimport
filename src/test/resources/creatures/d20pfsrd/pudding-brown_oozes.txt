SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A brown pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent’s clothing and armor (nonmetal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a brown pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
Suction (Ex) The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a brown pudding’s CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.
