SPECIAL ABILITIES
Glittering Radiance (Su) An orsheval usually glows with a golden light equivalent to that of a candle. In battle, its glow increases, filling the area within 5 feet of it with shining motes. These motes cling to all creatures in the affected area, outlining them as glitterdust for 6 rounds. Opponents in the area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be blinded; a blinded creature may attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the blindness. The motes persist for 1 round after the orsheval moves from a square, leaving a trailing cloud that can affect creatures that move into the affected area. The orsheval can suppress or reactivate the glow or motes as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
