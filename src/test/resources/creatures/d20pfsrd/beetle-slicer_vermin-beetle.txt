SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crippling Bite (Ex) A slicer beetle’s bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on a target, its mandibles cut deep, resulting in a wound that causes 1d6 bleed and leaving its foe staggered for 1d3 rounds from the tremendous pain dealt.
