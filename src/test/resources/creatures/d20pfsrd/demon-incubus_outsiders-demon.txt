SPECIAL ABILITIES
Pain Redoubled (Su) When an incubus confirms a critical hit with a melee weapon or a natural weapon, that attack deals an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be wracked by pain, becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds. Multiple uses of this ability extend the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
