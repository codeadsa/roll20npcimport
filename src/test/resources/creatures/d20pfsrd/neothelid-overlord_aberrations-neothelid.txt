SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Madness (Su) Any sane being within 60 feet of a conscious neothelid overlord must succeed at a DC 33 Will saving throw each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails 5 saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as per the insanity spell. A neothelid overlord can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Coordinated Attacks (Ex) A neothelid overlord can make attacks with the three tongues in each of its two heads.
It can attempt to swallow two targets at the same time, but if the neothelid overlord instead attacks the same target with all six tongues, it gains a +4 bonus on all combat maneuver checks to grab and swallow that target, regardless of how many tongues successfully hit. On a round in which it uses its breath weapon, a neothelid overlord can still attack with the three tongues belonging to its other head.
Divided Consciousness (Ex) The neothelid overlord’s two heads share a split consciousness that allows it to operate as though the overlord were constantly under the effect of a divide mind spell.
Trace Teleport (Ex) A neothelid overlord telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination of all creatures that use a teleport spell or effect within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to “seen casually.” This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This ability does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.
