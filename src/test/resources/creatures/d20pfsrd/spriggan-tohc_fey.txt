SPECIAL ABILITIES
Size Alteration (Su) At will, a spriggan can grow from Small to Large size or back again. Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the enlarge person spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, –2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a –2 to AC. While enlarged, a spriggan cannot use its spell-like abilities or its innate sneak attack ability (though any other sneak attack it may have, such as from rogue class levels, is unaffected when it changes size).
Spriggan (enlarged)
This loutish creature appears brutish even for a giant, with bulbous nose, scraggly hair and patchy beard. The smell emanating from it is no surprise considering the filth of itself and its clothing.
