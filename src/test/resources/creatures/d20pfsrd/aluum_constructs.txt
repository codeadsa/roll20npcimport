SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as channel negative energy, inflict light wounds, or enervation) deals no damage, but speeds up the aluum’s attacks and movement as if it were under the effects of a haste spell for 1d6 rounds. A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum as if by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and dispels any haste effects currently affecting it. Magic jar confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.
Paralysis (Su) The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Soul Shriek (Su) As a free action every 1d4 rounds, the aluum’s enslaved souls may emit a keening wail in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round. A DC 15 Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. This is a sonic mind affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
