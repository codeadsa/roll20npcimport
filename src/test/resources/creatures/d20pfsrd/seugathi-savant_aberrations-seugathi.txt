SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Madness (Su) Any sane being within 30 feet of a conscious seugathi savant must succeed at a DC 21 Will save each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails five saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as the insanity spell. A seugathi savant can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Confusion Command (Su) As an immediate action, a seugathi savant can issue a telepathic command to a confused creature within 30 feet. This allows the seugathi savant to pick a result from the confusion behavior table, rather than the confused creature rolling randomly for its actions that round.
Item Use (Ex) A seugathi savant can utilize spell-trigger devices as if it were a spellcaster of the appropriate class. As a free action, it can identify all spell-trigger properties of an item it is touching. Use Magic Device is a class skill for seugathi savants.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis damage and deafness; cure 2 consecutive saves. Deafness persists as long as the ability damage caused by the poison lasts. The save DC is Constitution-based.
