SPECIAL ABILITIES
War Stomp (Su) Rajput ambaris are trained to slam their skeletal front feet hard into the earth, creating a small shockwave that can knock nearby opponents prone. Any opponent standing immediately adjacent to a rajput ambari when it uses this ability must make a DC 28 Reflex save or be knocked prone. War stomp is a full-round action. The save DC is Strength-based.
Undead Servitor Rajput ambaris are completely subservient to their creators and any other creature capable of commanding undead. A rajput ambari is treated as an undead creature of half its Hit Dice for the purposes of being commanded and when counting the total Hit Dice of undead an evil cleric has under his control. A rajput ambari always understands the language of its master and anyone controlling it.
