SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Spit (Ex) A chon chon can spit a disgusting blob of acid at a single foe, making a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and no range increment. A successful attack deals 1d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Jabber (Su) A chon chon endlessly mutters half-remembered spells and meaningless arcane formulae to itself. This jabbering creates a kind of magical static that interferes with spells being cast nearby. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 15 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.
