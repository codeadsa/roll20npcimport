Stunning Shock (Su) A siyokoy can emit a strong electrical charge from its tail. When it hits a creature with its tail slap, the attack deals 3d6 points of electrical damage and the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Swim-By Attack (Ex) Extremely quick in the water, a siyokoy gains Spring Attack as a bonus feat when swimming.
