SPECIAL ABILITIES
Allergen Aura (Ex) A blodeuwedd exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens that forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who successfully save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd’s aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura at Will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Change Shape (Su) A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell polymorph. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can return to her normal shape as a free action.
Nature’s Infusion (Su) Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour.
Verdant Step (Su) Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day.
Wild Empathy (Ex) This works like the druid’s wild empathy class feature, except a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.
