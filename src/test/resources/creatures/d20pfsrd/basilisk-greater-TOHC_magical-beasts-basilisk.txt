SPECIAL ABILITIES
Foul Breath (Ex) A greater basilisk’s breath is extremely foul. Any creature in a space directly in front of a greater basilisk must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the breath of the same greater basilisk for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gaze (Ex) Turn to stone permanently (as stone to flesh), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. A creature petrified in this manner that is then coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk no more that 1 hour dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single greater basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d4 Medium creatures in this manner. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Claw—injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con; cure 1 save.
