SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Dive (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a marine crocodile can perform a deadly dive upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it uses the force of its powerful tail to propel it downward in the water, allowing it to use both the move and damage actions as part of its grapple attempt. If successful, the marine crocodile maintains its grapple.
Hold Breath (Ex) A marine crocodile can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 8 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
