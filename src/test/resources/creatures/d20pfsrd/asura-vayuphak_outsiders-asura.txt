SPECIAL ABILITIES
Enveloping Winds (Su) As an immediate action, a vayuphak can surround itself with a whirling torrent of air to protect it from ranged attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons have a 20% miss chance against the vayuphak, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a giant’s thrown rock or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray attacks.
