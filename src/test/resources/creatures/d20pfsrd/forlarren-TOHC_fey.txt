SPECIAL ABILITIES
Heat Metal (Su) Once per day, by making a melee touch attack, a forlarren can heat metal (as the spell, caster level 6th, DC 12 Will save). Once the affected metal reaches the searing stage (after 3 rounds), it remains at that stage until the forlarren is killed, moves more than 100 feet from the target, or dismisses the effect (as a free action). Once the effect has been dismissed, the metal slowly returns to its normal temperature (just as in the spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.
