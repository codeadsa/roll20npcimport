SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dweomer Leap (Su) When a dweomercat cub is targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a spell, it can, as an immediate action, choose to teleport to a square adjacent to the spell’s caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and aimed toward the caster. This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercat cub’s spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat cub can immediately make a full attack against the spell’s caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent to the caster—or if the dweomercat cub’s chooses—the dweomercat cub can forgo using this ability.
