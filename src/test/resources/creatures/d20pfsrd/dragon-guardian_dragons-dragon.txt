SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agonizing Venom (Ex) Any creature failing its saving throw against the dragon’s breath weapon, poison, or poisonous blood is sickened with pain for 1 minute. A second, third, and fourth failed saving throw mean the creature is also staggered for 1 minute, nauseated for 1 minute, and helpless for 1 minute, respectively. This is a pain effect. If the dragon expends one use of Mythic Power when poisoning a creature, the dragon’s breath weapon and poison overcome any poison immunity the target has.
Aura of Security (Su) A guardian dragon is alerted whenever a Tiny or larger creature enters its aura (as a mental alarm spell). If its dimensional lock spell-like ability is dispelled or destroyed, it may expend two uses of Mythic Power to cast it again. The dragon can use its false vision spell-like ability only within its aura, and the duration ends if the aura’s area no longer includes the affected area.
Heroic Challenge (Su) Once per day, a guardian dragon can give a Non-Mythic creature the agile, arcane, divine, invincible, or savage Mythic template. The dragon must expend a number of uses of Mythic Power equal to the amount the target creature’s CR increases. The creature isn’t under the dragon’s control, but won’t willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of Mythic Power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on). The effects of this ability persist as long as the dragon remains within 10 miles of the affected creature or area.
Lingering Poisonous Cloud (Su) The guardian dragon can expend one use of Mythic Power when it uses its breath weapon to have the cloud remain for 10 rounds, functioning as cloudkill. The dragon can expend one additional use of Mythic Power for this to function as Mythic cloudkill.
Poison (Ex) Bite or swallow whole—injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Secret Lair (Su) A guardian dragon can spend 1 hour concentrating to create a labyrinthine extradimensional lair for itself and whatever it is guarding. This functions like greater create demiplane and creates a demiplane with the morphic, portal, shape, and structure properties. The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a maze of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane’s portal is connected to a spot in the dragon’s hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane’s defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen.
Vengeful Seeker (Ex) A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure. Any divination spell-like ability a guardian dragon uses to locate such a creature or its treasure counts as the Mythic version of the spell, if appropriate.
