SPECIAL ABILITIES
Explosion (Ex) When a gorbel is hit with a weapon, spell, or effect that deals piercing or slashing damage, it must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage taken) or instantly explode, dealing 1d4 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet. This instantly kills the gorbel. Creatures in the affected area can attempt a DC 12 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Grab and Bite (Ex) A gorbel can bite a grappled opponent as a swift action with a +4 attack bonus.
