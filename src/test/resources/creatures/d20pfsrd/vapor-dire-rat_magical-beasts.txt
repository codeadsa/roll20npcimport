TACTICS
Vapor dire rats attack with their bite. A pack uses ambush tactics against potential prey, and when attacking, they often attempt to flank their foe, sending several rats against the creature’s flank while the rest hit from the front or sides. Injured vapor dire rats drop back where they can use their fast healing ability (if they are near a source of water, fog, steam, or mist) while the holes in their ranks are filled by other vapor dire rats. Vapor dire rats usually assume vapor form and attempt to escape if they lose more than half their numbers.
