SPECIAL ABILITIES
Scream (Su) A screaming devilkin can howl continuously as a free action. This painful howling affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one round. The save DC is Charisma-based. The effects of multiple screaming devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not cumulative; only one save need be made each round. Conversation, even shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this ability. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) each time they try to cast a spell. Silence negates the devilkinâ€™s scream for the duration of the spell.
