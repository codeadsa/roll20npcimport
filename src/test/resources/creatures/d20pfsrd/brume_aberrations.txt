SPECIAL ABILITIES
Charisma Damage (Su) Any creature touched or hit by a brume takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A creature reduced to Charisma 0 by a brume dies.
Memory Loss (Su) An opponent hit by a brume’s claw attack must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or forget everything that has happened in the last 1d6 hours (treat this as a modify memory spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (caster level 13th) for 2d4 hours. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.
Insubstantial Form (Ex) A brume’s insubstantial form gives it immunity to poison and critical hits. It cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings—even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell—note the brume is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell allows.) Any piercing or slashing attack against a brume has a 20% miss chance. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.
Lifesense (Su) A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature within 120 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
Natural Invisibility (Ex) A brume is effectively invisible in fog, smoke, or mist.
