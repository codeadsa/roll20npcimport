SPECIAL ABILITIES
Superior Climbing (Ex) A carrion claw need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down.) It retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
Vulnerable to Magical Light (Ex) A carrion claw that is the target of a spell with the light descriptor must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The Will save DC is equal to 10 + the spell level + the caster’s key ability.
