SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Unraveled Fate (Su) A faerie seer stands outside the fabric of time. As such, the area around him is in constant flux as a myriad of possible futures exist within the same space and are constantly competing for dominance. Attack rolls made within the aura must be rolled twice and the attacker must take the lower of the two results. A Will save DC 19 can be made to avoid this effect.
