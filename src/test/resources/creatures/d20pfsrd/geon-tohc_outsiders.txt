SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animate Boulders (Sp) A geon can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two rocks at a time. Boulders move at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon in all respects. Animated boulders lose their ability to move if the geon that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather than trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that a geon has.
