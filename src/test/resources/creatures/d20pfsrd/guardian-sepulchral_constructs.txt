SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Su) A creature damaged by a sepulchral guardian’s slam attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or contract crypt death, a supernatural disease created long ago by a spellcaster whose name has been lost over time. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Crypt Death: Disease–slam; save Fort DC 17; onset 1minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.
Dread (Su) Creatures viewing a sepulchral guardian must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken as long as the sepulchral guardian is “alive” and within 100 feet and for 2d4 rounds afterwards. A successful save renders the target immune to the guardian’s dread for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
