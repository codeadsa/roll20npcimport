SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ink Cloud (Ex) Once per minute as a swift action, a giant water beetle can emit a cloud of jet-black ink that fills a 10-foot cube. The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Water Dependent (Ex) Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, they begin to suffocate.
Watersense (Ex) A giant water beetle’s watersense ability functions exactly like blindsense, except it only functions underwater.
