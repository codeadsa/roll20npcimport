Gear Kraken’s Bite
GEAR Unique Item: Kraken’s Bite
Moloch’s unique weapon Kraken’s Bite is a Large +4 unholy shocking six-tailed whip.
It does lethal damage as a heavy flail and does threaten the squares in its range but has the reach of a whip. In addition if used to make trip or disarm attacks, then the wielder can make six trip or disarm attempts in a round as a full-round action and receive the benefits of having both the Improved Trip and Improved Disarm feats, even if he does not have the necessary prerequisites.
