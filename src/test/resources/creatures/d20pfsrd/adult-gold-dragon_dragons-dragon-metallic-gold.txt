SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.
Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.
Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.
Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon’s hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).
