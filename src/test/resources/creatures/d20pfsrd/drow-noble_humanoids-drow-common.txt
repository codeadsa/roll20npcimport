Drow Noble Characters Drow nobles are defined by their class levels—they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble’s challenge rating is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed for drow characters, plus the following:
+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution. Noble drow are very agile, observant, and regal. These ability score modifiers replace the standard drow ability score modifiers. Spell Resistance: Drow nobles have spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level. Spell-Like Abilities: Drow nobles can cast dancing lights, deeper darkness, faerie fire, feather fall, and levitate each at will, and have detect magic as a constant spell-like ability. A drow noble can also cast divine favor, dispel magic, and suggestion once per day each. In some cases, a drow noble’s spell-like abilities might vary, although the level of a particular spell-like ability does not. A drow noble’s caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her character level.
