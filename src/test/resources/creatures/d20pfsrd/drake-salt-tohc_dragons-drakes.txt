Training a Salt Drake
A salt drake requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a salt drake must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
Training a friendly salt drake requires ten weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal check. Riding a salt drake requires an exotic saddle. A salt drake can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
Salt drake eggs are worth 6,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 12,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 2,000 gp to rear or train a dragonnel.
Carrying Capacity: A light load for a salt drake is up to 516 pounds; a medium load, 517–1,038 pounds, and a heavy load, 1,039–1,560 pounds.
