SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ferrous Mind (Ex) Ferrous giants are immune to mind influencing effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
Pound (Ex) A ferrous giant that successfully grabs a foe two or more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+22 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must make a successful DC 37 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A ferrous giant can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.
Oversized Weapon Use (Ex) A ferrous giant wields a Gargantuan greatsword or greataxe without penalty.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex) Ferrous giants are automatically proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.
