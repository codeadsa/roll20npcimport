TACTICS
Warden jack swarms have two modes of attack: as moving caltrops, or as rolling marbles. They set themselves up for combat by rolling into the path of their opponents and extending their spikes.
During Combat Once combat begins, most of them roll around continually, extending their spikes and attempting to wound an opponent. Some remain in spheroid form in order to get under the feet of a foe and bring it to the ground. Extending or retracting spikes is a free action for the warden jack swarm.
