SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animalistic (Ex) Jubears have the resistance of animals. They have good Fortitude and Reflex saves while having poor Will saves.
Digestive Ooze (Ex) An opponent pinned by the jubear takes 1d6 points of acid damage.
Swallow Whole (Ex) A creature pinned for three consecutive rounds is swallowed whole. A swallowed opponent takes 3d6 points of acid damage each round. A swallowed creature can escape by doing 9 points of damage to the inside of the bear with a light slashing or piercing weapon (AC 15). A creature that escapes the pin while swallowed whole emerges from the bearâ€™s stomach, not its throat, where it may be grabbed and pinned again.
