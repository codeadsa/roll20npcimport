SPECIAL ABILITIES
Danse Macabre (Su) As a standard action, a danse macabre can attempt to inflict its namesake ability on a single humanoid or monstrous humanoid within 30 feet. The victim must make a DC 13 Will save or start to dance for up to 4 rounds. While dancing, the victim can take a single 5-foot step each round (a free action). The victim suffers a -4 penalty to Dexterity while dancing (since he’s not in control of his body). The victim can speak normally, but cannot attempt any other actions except attempting to break the enchantment. On the victim’s next turn only, he may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the victim dances for the entire duration. A danse macabre can use this ability 4 times per day. This is a mind-affecting compulsion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
