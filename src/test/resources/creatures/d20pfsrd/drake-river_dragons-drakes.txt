SPECIAL ABILITIES
Caustic Mucus (Su) As a standard action, a river drake can spit a ball of caustic mucus that explodes in a 5-foot-radius spread. This attack has a range of 50 feet, deals 2d8 points of acid damage, and entangles creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangle effect. An entangled creature takes 1d4 points of acid damage each round on its turn, and may attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round to escape the entanglement and end the acid damage. Once a river drake spits mucus, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a river drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.
