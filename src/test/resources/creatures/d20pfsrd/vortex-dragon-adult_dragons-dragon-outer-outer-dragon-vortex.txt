SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agile (Ex) Vortex dragons have good maneuverability when flying regardless of their age or size.
Alien Presence (Su) A vortex dragon’s alien presence bends space. A creature that fails its saving throw treats all other creatures as if they were under the effects of blur (or displacement if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.
Fragmented Strike (Su) An adult or older vortex dragon can strike with its bite through a rift in space. This allows it to make its bite attack against a target anywhere within the radius of its alien presence as long as the dragon can see the creature. This doesn’t apply to attacks of opportunity.
Galactic Emissary (Su) A young or older vortex dragon halves the time of any starflight journey. In addition, it’s immune to any effect that bars extradimensional travel.
