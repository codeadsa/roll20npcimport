SPECIAL ABILITIES
Possession (Su) A demonic mohrg’s fiendish spirit can attempt to leap into another host when it is destroyed. At this point, the demonic mohrg can attempt to possess any one creature within 30 feet to which it has line of sight as an immediate action. The targeted creature can resist being possessed if it makes a DC 23 Will save. If it fails, the demonic mohrg possesses that target as if via magic jar, but with no duration for the effect and without the need for a receptacle. Typically, the demonic spirit lies low if it successfully possesses a new host, waiting until the right moment to seize control of the host and start a new chain of horrific murders. In this way, a demonic spirit can jump from host to host, for each time its host is executed, it rises anew as a demonic mohrg. The possessing spirit can be driven from a living host with a successful dispel chaos or dispel evil spell, instantly destroying the spirit and ending the cycle, but such tactics have no effect on the creature after it has animated an executed body as a demonic mohrg. The save DC is Charisma-based.
