SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agile (Ex) A torturer robot adds its Dexterity modifier to its damage rolls in place of its Strength modifier when using its rotating blades attack.
Force Field (Ex) A field of shimmering energy surrounds a torturer robot. Damage dealt to the robot is applied to the force field first. As long as the field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. The force field has fast healing 8, but once the field’s hit points are reduced to 0, the field collapses and does not reactive for 24 hours.
Interrogate (Ex) As a standard action, the torturer robot can attempt a Heal check to deal 1d4 points of damage to an ability of its choice possessed by an adjacent, helpless target.
A successful Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to the robot’s Heal check result negates this damage.
Nanosurgeon (Ex) As a standard action, a torturer robot can inject purpose-programmed nanites into a target as a melee touch attack. The nanites produce one of the following effects or conditions (CL 10th, where applicable): cure serious wounds, lesser restoration, neutralize poison, remove disease, exhaustion, nauseated for 1d4 rounds, or paralyzed (nauseated targets only, for remainder of original duration).
If the victim succeeds at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw, exhaustion is reduced to fatigue, nauseated is reduced to sickened, and other effects are negated. The torturer robot carries 5 doses of nanites, and it constructs replacements at a rate of 1 dose per hour. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Surgical Lasers (Ex) The torturer robot’s lasers have a range of 50 feet with no range increment, and threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Lasers pass through transparent creatures and objects without causing harm (including force fields, force effects, and invisible creatures; it can pass through glass, but the glass takes damage), and can strike targets behind them normally. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.
