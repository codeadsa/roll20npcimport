SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Ex) A schir gnaws constantly at the ends of its halberd. This infuses the blades with disease from the demon’s filthy spittle. Any creature struck by a schir’s halberd must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract gray pox—a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gray Pox: Halberd—injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
