SPECIAL ABILITIES
Air Breathing (Ex) The river dragon can breathe air just as naturally as water. This dragon can freely use its breath weapon, spells and other abilities in both air and water.
Boiling Aura (Su) This river dragon radiates heat causing any water around it to boil. All creatures within 10 ft. of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. The river dragon can suppress or activate this ability at will as a free action.
Speak with Aquatic (Ex) This river dragon has a constant spell-like ability to speak with animals of the aquatic subtype. This otherwise functions as speak with animals.
Spit (Ex) This river dragon has the ability to spit water at any target within 30 ft. as a ranged overrun attempt. The CMB check for the spit is the river dragon’s CMB but is one size category smaller than the river dragon and gains the benefits of the Improved Overrun feat. This does not grant the river dragon the benefits of the Improved Overrun feat when making a overrun attempt and not spitting.
Watersight (Ex) This river dragon can see underwater four times better than a human.
