SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attraction (Ex) The front four legs of a sand stalker are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across them, they create a hypnotic sound that can be heard by all creatures within a 100-foot spread. Those hearing this sound must make a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same sand stalker’s attraction for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
An entranced victim takes the most direct route possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the sand stalker’s legs are subjected to wind. A bard’s countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.
Poison (Ex) Bite–injury, save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect paralysis and 1 Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Strength-based.
