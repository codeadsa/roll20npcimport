SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapons (Su) As a standard action, a dragon horse can breathe out a 30-foot cone of mist. This mist either deals 10d6 points of cold damage (DC 20 Reflex half), creates a region of fog in the area that lasts for 1 minute (similar to that created by a fog cloud spell), or creates a blast of severe wind in the area. The dragon horse may use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Flying Charge (Ex) A dragon horse gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls if it charges while flying.
Know Alignment (Su) Dragon horses automatically know the alignment of any creature they can see.
Shift Planes (Su) A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Plane of Air, or Material Plane once per day as a standard action. This functions as plane shift, but the dragon horse can only bring up to two other willing creatures with it, and only if they are on its back.
