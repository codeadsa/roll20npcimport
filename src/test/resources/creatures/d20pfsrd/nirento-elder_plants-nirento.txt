SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hypnotic Display (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a nirento can sway and dance in such a way that it attracts any who see the tree within a 60-foot radius. Any creatures other than nirentos in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become entranced by the nirento’s graceful movements, thereafter believing the nirento to be a perfectly normal tree. Affected creatures become passive for 1d6 minutes and refuse to attack the nirento during this time. Affected creatures can attempt a new Will save each round that the nirento attacks an ally—if a hypnotized creature is attacked by the nirento, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hypnotic display. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Uproot (Ex) As a full-round action, a nirento can thrust its vines into the soil and attack up to four creatures around it in a 10-foot radius. Creatures in this area take 1d8+5 points of damage (DC 17 Reflex half). In addition, a nirento can attempt to trip any creatures that fail their Reflex saves as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.
