SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A lead skeleton is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

A magical attack that deals sonic damage slows a lead skeleton (as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.
