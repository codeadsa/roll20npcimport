SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aerial Passivism (Ex) No aerial creature (defined in his dominate aerial creatures special attack) of 10 HD or less willingly attacks Pazuzu (but can be forced to magically). If attacked by a magically compelled aerial creature, Pazuzu can make an Intelligence check (opposed by the spellcaster’s caster level that compelled the aerial creature). If Pazuzu wins the opposed check, he automatically breaks the magical compulsion controlling the creature (as if by greater dispel magic).
Breath Weapons (Su) Pazuzu has three breath weapons, each detailed below. Regardless of which breath weapon he uses, he can’t breathe more than once every 1d4 rounds. Each breath weapon is a 100-foot long cone. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for Pazuzu’s Ability Focus feat.
Creeping Doom: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th). Insect Plague: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th). Corrosive Gas: Damage 16d6 acid, DC 40 Reflex half. Dominate Aerial Creatures (Su) Pazuzu can automatically dominate any aerial creature of 6 HD or less that is within sight as a free action. Targeted creatures do not get a save against this effect. This functions as a charm monster spell (CL 20th). At any one time, Pazuzu can have a total of 40 HD of creatures dominated. Affected creatures must remain with sight or the effect ends. Aerial creatures are defined as avians (including giant and dire versions), gargoyles, harpies, and creatures with the air subtype.
GEAR Unique Item: Carriontooth Pazuzu’s unique weapon is a +5 anarchic keen greatsword.
