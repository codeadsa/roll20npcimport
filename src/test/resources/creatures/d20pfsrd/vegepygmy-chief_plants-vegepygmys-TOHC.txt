SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spores (Ex) The chief is the only vegepygmy with a spore attack. As a standard action, a chief vegepygmy can release a cloud of spores in a 40-foot spread. A living creature caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. After the paralysis wears off, the character must succeed on another DC 17 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of Constitution damage. This save DC is Constitution-based. At Constitution 0 a creature dies, and rises as a 4 HD vegepygmy bodyguard in one day. If a remove disease spell is cast on a paralyzed victim before the paralysis wears off, he does not have to attempt the second Fortitude save and takes no Constitution damage.
