SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a gare linnorm can breathe a 60-foot cone of scalding steam, dealing 17d8 points of fire damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 25 halves). This steam then hangs in the air for 1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures in the area of effect or that enter the area take an additional 6d6 points of fire damage the second round (Reflex DC 25 negates). In addition, the cloud of steam acts as the spell solid fog, with a caster level equal to the linnorm’s HD. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a gare linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of the drowning gasp.
Curse of the Drowning Gasp: save Will DC 22; effect anytime the creature imbibes a liquid of any kind, its lungs fill with water and it begins to drown. Treat this as the spell suffocation (DC 19 Fort save to resist), with a caster level equal to the linnorm’s Hit Dice. The save DC for the curse is Charisma-based.
Freedom of Movement (Ex) A gare linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Poison (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6 fire damage and 1d6 Dex drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
True Seeing (Ex) A gare linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
