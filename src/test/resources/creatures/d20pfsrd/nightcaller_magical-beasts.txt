SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mimic (Ex) Nightcallers may make Bluff checks to imitate cries for help in either Common, Elf or Gnome. A successful Bluff check leaves its target flat footed until the nightcaller’s next turn. Creatures that have been attacked by a nightcaller (or have had their allies attacked by a nightcaller) are immune to a nightcaller’s mimic for 24 hours.
