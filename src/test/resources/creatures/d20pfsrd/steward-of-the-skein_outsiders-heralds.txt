SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fate Aura (Su) The herald’s aura acts as consecrate and grants her a +4 deflection bonus to AC, a +5 insight bonus to AC, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any creature striking the herald from within her aura either is blinded or takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (herald’s choice, Will DC 25 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gaze (Su) Dazed 2d6 rounds (or stunned if 5 HD or fewer, or held for 2d6 rounds if undead), 60 feet; Will DC 25 negates.
A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect (or a necromancy effect against undead). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Incorporeal Form (Su) When incorporeal, the herald can use her spell-like abilities and gaze attack but can’t make slam attacks.
