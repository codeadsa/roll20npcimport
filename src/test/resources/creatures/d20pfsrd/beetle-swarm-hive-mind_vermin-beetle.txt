SPECIAL ABILITIES
Exposed Nerves (Ex) Whenever a hive mind beetle swarm is at or below half its full hit points, its Intelligence score drops to 9 and it loses its spellcasting ability. When at or below one-quarter its full hit points, it becomes effectively mindless and can only use feats that provide a static bonus.
Reflexive Dodge (Ex) The constituent creatures of a hive mind beetle swarm can dodge attacks, forming holes in the swarm. It gains a +8 dodge bonus to its AC.
