SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A mantidrake’s breath weapon depends on what type of dragon parent it had, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a mantidrake’s breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 19 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
To determine a mantidrake’s draconic parent and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.
1d10 Draconic Parent Breath Weapon
1-2 Black 60-foot line of acid
3-4 Blue 60-foot line of lightning
5-6 Green 30-foot cone of gas (acid)
7-8 Red 30-foot cone of fire
9-10 White 30-foot cone of cold
Spikes (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a mantidrake can loose a volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in a single day.
Immunity to Energy (Ex) A mantidrake is immune to one type of energy based on its draconic heritage: black, immunity to acid; blue, immunity to electricity; green, immunity to acid; red, immunity to fire; white, immunity to cold.
