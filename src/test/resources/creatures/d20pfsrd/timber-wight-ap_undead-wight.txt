SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rooted Foot (Ex) The timber wight can stand up from being prone as a swift action instead of a move action.
Wicked Thorns (Ex) Any creature striking a timber wight with its body or a hand-held weapon deals damage normally, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d3 points of piercing damage. Any creature involved in a grapple with the timber wight automatically takes this damage once per round at the beginning of the timber wight’s turn.
