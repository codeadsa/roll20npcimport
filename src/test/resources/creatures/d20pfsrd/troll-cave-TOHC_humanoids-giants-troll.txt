TACTICS
Cave trolls often use deception when they first encounter prey, especially intelligent prey. Their troll heritage often leads to the misconception that they are slow in combat, which they gladly allow their opponents to believe – until the cave troll strikes or moves. Only then is the ruse negated and the true nature of the troll revealed. Cave trolls attack by grabbing and rending an opponent.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Haste (Su) A cave troll is affected by a permanent haste spell (caster level 8th). This grants the cave troll a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (both already figured into the stat block above). Any condition that makes the cave troll lose its Dexterity bonus to AC also makes it lose its dodge bonus. This is an inherent bonus and cannot be dispelled or negated.
When making a full attack action, a cave troll can make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding or one extra claw attack (if using natural weapons). The extra attack is at the cave troll’s full attack bonus.
Spider Climb (Su) A cave troll can climb sheer surfaces as though by a spider climb spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated or dispelled. The cave troll can restart it again on its next turn as a free action.
