SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Strike (Su) A grim reaper automatically confirms any critical hit. A creature damaged by a critical hit from a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude saving throw or be instantly killed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Death’s Grace (Su) The dark power stolen from countless souls protects a grim reaper, granting it a profane bonus on all saving throws and to AC equal to its Charisma modifier.
Final Death (Su) A creature killed by a grim reaper can’t be brought back to life by any means short of divine intervention.
Misfortune Aura (Su) When a living creature attempts an ability check, attack roll, caster level check, skill check, or saving throw within 20 feet of a grim reaper, it must roll two d20s and take the lowest roll before applying any modifiers.
Status Sight (Su) When a grim reaper gazes on a creature, it can see that creature’s emotion aura and that creature’s current health and overall well-being. This acts as the status spell, as well as the emotion aura aspect of the analyze aura spell.
