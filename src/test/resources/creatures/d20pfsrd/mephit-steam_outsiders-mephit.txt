SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Each type of mephit can unleash a particular breath weapon every 4 rounds as a standard action. The DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
The breath weapon of a steam mephit is a cone of steam that deals 1d4 fire damage. The scalding water also causes living creatures to be sickened for 3 rounds. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect.
Boiling Rain (Su) Once per day a steam mephit can create a rainstorm of boiling water in a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures within the area take 2d6 points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
