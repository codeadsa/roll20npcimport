TACTICS
Pechs are generally noncombative, preferring to avoid such encounters if possible. If forced into combat, a pech relies on its pick and spell-like abilities to dispatch its opponents. Multiple pechs often work in concert with one another using their wall of stone ability to instantly erect a barrier that either traps their opponents or allows the pechs a means of escape.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Earth Mastery (Ex) A pech gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage bonus if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the pech takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
Light Blindness (Ex) Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds a pech for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.
Stone Knowledge (Ex) The extensive knowledge of stone that a pech possesses grants it a +1 racial bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, and so on).
