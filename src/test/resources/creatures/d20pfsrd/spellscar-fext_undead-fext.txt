SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deadly Slam (Ex) A spellscarred fext threatens a critical hit with its slam attack on rolls of 18–20.
Dispelling Critical (Su) Whenever a spellscarred fext successfully scores a critical hit with its slam attack, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by the targeted dispel version of a dispel magic spell (caster level 10th). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Ravage Magic (Su) Any targeted spell or spell-like ability that fails to penetrate a spellscarred fext’s spell resistance is absorbed by the fext and warped into a form of primal magic. A spellscarred fext can twist only a number of spell levels per round equal to its Charisma modifier (4 for most spellscarred fexts); any spells in excess of this limit automatically bypass a spellscarred fext’s spell resistance and don’t trigger this ability.
Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a spell that has been affected by a spellscarred fext’s ravage magic ability.
d% Effect
01–40 The spell has no effect.
41–70 The spellscarred fext emits a burst of negative energy, dealing a number of points of negative energy damage equal to 1d6 x the spell level of the triggering spell to all creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst.
71–90 The spellscarred fext instantly switches places with the spellcaster that targeted the fext with the triggering spell as though by dimension door.
91–100 The spell is immediately turned back on its caster via spell turning.
Vulnerable to Glass (Ex) A spellscar fext’s hide is particularly vulnerable to the penetrations of glass and glass-based weapons. Spellscarred fexts take 150% as much damage as normal from glass-headed piercing or slashing weapons.
