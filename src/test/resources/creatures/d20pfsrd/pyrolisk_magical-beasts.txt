SPECIAL ABILITIES
Conflagration Gaze (Su) A creature within 30 feet that meets a pyrolisk’s gaze bursts into flames, taking 4d8 points of damage (DC 13 Fortitude halves). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pyrolisk’s conflagration gaze for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Pyrotechnics (Su) Once per round, a pyrolisk can use pyrotechnics as the spell (caster level 4th). The pyrolisk can only use the fireworks version of the spell. A DC 13 Will save negates the blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based.
