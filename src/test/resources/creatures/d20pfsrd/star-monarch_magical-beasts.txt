SPECIAL ABILITIES Dreamwarden (Su) Any sleeping creature within 30 feet of a star monarch is protected by protection from evil and sanctuary (Will DC 15 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Glowsap (Ex) As a standard action, a star monarch can spray a target within 30 feet with an adhesive spittle as a ranged touch attack. A creature struck is affected as a tanglefoot bag (Reflex DC 20 partial). In addition, this adhesive glows under starlight or moonlight, limning the target as faerie fire if used outdoors at night. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Navigational Awareness (Ex) Star monarchs never become lost and are immune to maze spells or any effect that would cause them to lose their sense of direction.
Starflight (Su) A star monarch can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM’s discretion).
Toxic Flesh (Ex) A star monarch’s flesh is poisonous. A creature biting it or ingesting any part of its body becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates) and is affected as if it had consumed a dose of arsenic.
