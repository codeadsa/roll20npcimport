SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bounding Charge (Ex) A confounding bandersnatch can move through difficult terrain when it charges.
Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a confounding bandersnatch’s tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap. A confounding bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on attack rolls when using its tail slap.
Gaze (Su) Confused, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 29 negates. A confounding bandersnatch can direct its gaze attack against a single foe as a swift action. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a confounding bandersnatch can make a single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A confounding bandersnatch cannot lash out on the same round it charges.
Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a confounding bandersnatch’s tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Planar Acclimation (Ex) A confounding bandersnatch is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Poison (Ex) Confounding bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their quills and claws.

Claws and quills—injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect confused for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a confounding bandersnatch with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d10* points of piercing damage from the confounding bandersnatch’s quills and suffers from the confounding bandersnatch’s pain attack.
Quick Recovery (Su) A debilitated confounding bandersnatch recovers with frightening speed. If a confounding bandersnatch starts its turn affected by any or all of the following conditions, these conditions end at the end of its turn: confused, dazed, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and stunned. Furthermore, a confounding bandersnatch affected by ability damage, ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save receives a single additional save against the effect of its choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to shake off the effect.
Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a confounding bandersnatch can loose a volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during which the confounding bandersnatch’s defensive abilities are unaffected.
Relentless Tracker (Ex) A confounding bandersnatch can move at up to double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track creatures it has wounded.
