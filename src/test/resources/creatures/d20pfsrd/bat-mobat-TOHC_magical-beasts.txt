SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sonic Screech (Su) A mobat can blast an ear-splitting screech that affects all creatures (except other mobats) within a 20-ft. radius. The screech stuns any creature in the area for 1d3 rounds if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save succeeds an affected creature is immune to the same mobat’s screech for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
