SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Ex) A dragonleaf tree can issue forth a breath weapon from its leaves appropriate to the dragon it honors. The tree can do this 2/day, and once expended, this ability must be recharged by an old (or older) dragon with a use of its own breath weapon. (The maximum number of charges it can hold is 2.) The creature’s breath weapon deals 14d6 damage (DC 21 Reflex save for half damage). A black, copper, or green tree breathes a 60-ft. line of acid; a blue or bronze tree breathes a 60-ft. line of electricity; a brass, gold, or red tree breathes a 30-ft. cone of fire; and a silver or white tree breathes a 30-ft. cone of cold.
Immunities (Ex) A dragonleaf tree enjoys the same immunities as its progenitor. Black, copper, and green trees are immune to acid; blue and bronze trees are immune to electricity; brass, gold, and red trees are immune to fire; and silver and white trees are immune to cold.
Loyal to Dragon Master (Su) A dragonleaf tree only follows commands from its designated master (or from any creatures the master grants control to). It gains a +8 morale bonus to Will saves against any charm or compulsion spell or effect. Additionally, the tree has a +8 morale bonus to resist any Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks made to influence it to act against its masters.
Weaknesses (Ex) Dragonleaf trees with immunity to fire also have vulnerability to cold, and trees with immunity to cold have vulnerability to fire.
