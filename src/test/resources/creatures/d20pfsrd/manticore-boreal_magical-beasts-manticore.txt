SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spikes (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.
Trackless Step (Ex) A boreal manticore does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail if it so desires.
