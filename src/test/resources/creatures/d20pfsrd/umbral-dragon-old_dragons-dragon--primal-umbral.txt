SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Although it deals negative energy damage, an umbral dragon’s breath weapon does not heal undead creatures.
Ghost Bane (Su) A young or older umbral dragon’s physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally.
Shadow Breath (Su) Three times per day, an adult or older umbral dragon can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the dragon. A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points.
Umbral Scion (Ex) Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are immune to energy drain and death effects.
