SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A dungeon dragon’s breath weapon is a line or cone of warm mist. Creatures caught in the area must succeed on Fortitude save or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1d6 rounds.
Change Shape (Su) At will, a very young or older dungeon dragon can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid creature (as the alter self spell). It can remain in its humanoid form indefinitely. It cannot take the form of a specific individual.
Craft Crystal Ball (Ex) Dungeon dragon parents begin teaching their wyrmlings the necessary skills and spells to craft a crystal ball soon after they leave the egg. A dungeon dragon gains the Master Craftsman feat for free as a bonus feat without having to meet the prerequisites.
