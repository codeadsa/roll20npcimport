SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fate Drain (Su) A theletos possesses a pair of flexible crystalline tentacles with which it can drain a creature’s sense of fate and destiny. Whenever it strikes a foe with these tentacles, the creature struck must make a DC 17 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Until a creature’s Charisma damage from this ability is healed, the victim takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws (regardless of the actual total amount of Charisma damage it takes). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Wreath of Fate (Su) As a full-round action every 1d4 rounds, a theletos can release a 60-foot cone of energy from its chest. Any intelligent creature struck by this cone must make a DC 15 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for him—there is no way to make sense of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the victim is staggered. As long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check—he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment—the effective caster level of this curse is equal to the theletos’s HD (CL 9th in most cases). The save DC is Charisma-based.
