TACTICS
Raggoths are ambush hunters and always use stealth tactics when hunting and tracking their prey. When spotted, a raggoth moves slowly toward its target and then quickly bursts from its hiding spot at its opponent. If the raggoth doesnâ€™t fell its opponent in the first round, it lets loose its tormenting howl to weaken its prey before attempting to finish it off with its terrible claws and bite. A raggoth fights to the death only if cornered or defending its lair.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Stability (Ex) A raggoth gets a +4 bonus on checks made to resist being bull rushed when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
Tormenting Howl (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a raggoth can loose a piercing howl that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth for 24 hours. Multiple uses of tormenting howl do not stack but do increase the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
