SPECIAL ABILITIES
Entangle (Ex) A sea wasp can entangle a creature up to two sizes smaller than itself with its tentacles with a successful CMB check. An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature.
Poison (Ex) Sting–injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 1d6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC of the save is Constitution-based.
Jet (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water. An observer must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice the sea wasp.
Watersense (Ex) Monstrous sea wasps can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
