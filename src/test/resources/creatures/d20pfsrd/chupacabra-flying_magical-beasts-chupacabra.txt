SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chupar (Ex) A chupacabra that pins an opponent or maintains a pin can suck blood from that opponent as a free action once per round, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage. Upon successfully draining blood, the chupacabra is invigorated, gaining a significant boost in speed for 10 rounds similar to the haste spell. The invigorated chupacabra can still drain blood – and in so doing increase the length of its invigoration – but it gains no additional effects.
