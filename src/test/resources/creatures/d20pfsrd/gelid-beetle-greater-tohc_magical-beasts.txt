SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Ex) A greater gelid beetle’s body generates cold that deals an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a greater gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
Cold Cloud (Ex) Once per minute as a free action, a greater gelid beetle can emit a cloud of thick, billowing, icy cold vapors in a 20-foot radius around its body. The cloud is extremely thick and prevents effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays). Melee attack and damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty in the cloud. Each round, on the beetle’s turn, the cloud deals 2d6 points of cold damage to each creature within it. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitutionbased. The cloud lasts 1d4+3 rounds before dispersing.
