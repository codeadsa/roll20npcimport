TACTICS
Nupperibos unerringly follow the orders of their commander. They are relentless in their pursuit and attack, and continue to assault anything in their path until ordered to stop by their commander. A nupperibo killed in battle is 99% likely to be reformed (by a duke or arch-devil) into another nupperibo; the remaining 1% are “promoted” to lemure status, having proved their worth in combat.
