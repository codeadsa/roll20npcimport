TACTICS
Ice trolls savor the taste of human flesh and construct their lairs near civilized areas where humans are plentiful. Ice trolls often set traps for humans and either devours them immediately or captures them and carries them back to their lair. Captured humans are caged and fattened up before they are eaten.
Unlike their trollish cousins, ice trolls do not rush headlong into battle. They prefer to attack the weakest opponents first if they can. If combat goes against an ice troll, it does not hesitate to flee.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Slashing Weapon Vulnerability (Ex) If an opponent rolls a natural 20 with a slashing weapon against an ice troll (and subsequently confirms the critical hit), the ice troll must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage taken) or lose a limb (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left). An ice troll that loses a leg falls to the ground, but can continue moving at one-half speed. Severed limbs cannot attack but move at a speed of 30 feet toward the nearest source of water or ice.
Regeneration (Su) If an ice troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion grows back in 2d6 minutes so long as both the ice troll and lost body part are within 30 feet of each other and are both in contact with ice or water. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump, but only if the severed member has been in contact with ice or water for at least 1 round.
