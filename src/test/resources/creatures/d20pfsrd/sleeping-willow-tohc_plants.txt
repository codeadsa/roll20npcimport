SPECIAL ABILITIES
Constitution Drain (Su) Any creature grabbed by a sleeping willow must make a successful DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the hold is maintained as the sleeping willow drains the victim’s body fluids. The sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution, gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is absorbed by the sleeping willow’s roots. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Sleep Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a sleeping willow can eject a cloud of yellowish pollen from its body in a 30-foot spread. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 10 minutes. There is no HD limit for this sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
