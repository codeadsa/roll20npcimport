SPECIAL ABILITIES
Howl (Su) A churr can unleash a frightening howl as a standard action in a 60-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1d6 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same churr’s howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
