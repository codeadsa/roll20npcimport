SPECIAL ABILITIES
Archery Expert (Su) A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow in melee combat.
Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell.
Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giantâ€™s magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.
