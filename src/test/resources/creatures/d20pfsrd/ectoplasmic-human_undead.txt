SPECIAL ABILITIES
Horrifying Ooze (Su) Any creature struck by an ectoplasmic creature’s slam attack must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Phase Lurch (Su) An ectoplasmic creature has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. To use this ability, the ectoplasmic creature must begin and end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it’s moving through. An ectoplasmic creature cannot move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.
