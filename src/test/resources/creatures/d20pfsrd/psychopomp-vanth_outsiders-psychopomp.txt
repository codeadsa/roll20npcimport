SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fear Aura (Su) A creature of fewer than 10 Hit Dice that fails its save (DC 17) against the vanth’s fear aura is shaken for as long as it remains within the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that vanth’s aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Reaper’s Scythe (Su) Every vanth carries a distinctive adamantine scythe as both a weapon and a symbol of its duty. When the vanth wields its own scythe, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. As a free action, the vanth can summon its weapon from a personal demiplane or any other location and have it appear in its hands instantly. It can also dismiss its scythe back to its personal demiplane as a free action. If a vanth’s scythe is destroyed, it can summon a new one in 24 hours.
