SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attach (Ex) When a tidepool dragon hits with a claw attack, it automatically grapples its foe, dealing automatic damage with that claw each round.
Breath Weapon (Su) When a tidepool dragon uses its breath weapon underwater, it creates a 10-foot cone of superheated water rather than a line of fire (as noted above). This effect deals the breath weapon’s damage to any creatures in the cone’s area, though victims can still save to take only half damage.
