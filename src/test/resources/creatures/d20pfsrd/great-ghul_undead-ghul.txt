SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by a great ghul becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise; a janni slain becomes a ghul, and a more powerful genie a great ghul. Destroying the body or blessing it prevents this reanimation.
Cursed Claws (Ex) A great ghul’s claws are considered both cold iron and magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.
Genie-Kin (Ex) For all race-related effects (such as a ranger’s favored enemy), a great ghul is considered a genie even though its type is undead.
Heat (Ex) An efreeti great ghul can activate or deactivate its heat ability as a free action.
