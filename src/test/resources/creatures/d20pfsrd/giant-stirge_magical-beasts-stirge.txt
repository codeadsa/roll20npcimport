TACTICS
During Combat The giant stirge quickly crawls out of its nest to buzz hungrily at intruders, attacking anyone who enters its territory. If the stirge hears any form of music (such as that created by certain bardic performances or a Perform skill check), it ceases its attacks and swoops down to land next to the musician. As long as the bardic performance continues, or as long as the musician can continue to make DC 15 Perform checks (or as long as no one else attacks it), the giant stirge remains docile
Morale The giant stirge fights to the death.
