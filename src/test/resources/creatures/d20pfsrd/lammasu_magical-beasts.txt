SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells A lammasu casts spells as a 7th-level oracle, but does not gain any other class abilities possessed by an oracle. It ignores all divine focus material components for spells it casts. Lammasus are protectors of the weak and ever-vigilant champions against evil. These noble creatures dwell in crumbling desert ruins or other remote areas, where they tirelessly fight against the forces of darkness, hoping to defend those they consider lesser races from the evils that often lurk in such places.
