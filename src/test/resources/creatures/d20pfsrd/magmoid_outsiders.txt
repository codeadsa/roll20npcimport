SPECIAL ABILITIES
Burn (Ex) The body of a magmoid is composed of molten rock and elemental fire. Any melee hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time one of their attacks hits just as if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack.
Magma Blast (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a magmoid can release a line of magma to a range of 40 feet. This deals 2d6 points of damage in the round it hits a foe (DC 17 Reflex save for half), and 1d6 points of damage for another 1d3 rounds (no save).
Melt Weapons (Ex) Any metal weapon that strikes a magmoid must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.
