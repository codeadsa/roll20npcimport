SPECIAL ABILITIES
Binary State (Su) Most of the time the Burning Child is in a passive state, during which he’s incorporeal and invisible, though his soft sobs and the scent of burning flesh allow a creature to pinpoint his location with a successful DC 30 Perception check. If the Burning Child comes across a battle, the chance he enters his active state is equal to 1% per creature fighting (to a maximum of 100%). While active, the Burning Child is corporeal and visible. After 1d4 hours without being attacked or seeing conflict, the Burning Child reenters his passive state.
Breath Weapon (Su) The Burning Child can use his breath weapon only when in his active state, and only once each time he becomes active.
Final Embrace (Ex) If the Burning Child is destroyed, he reforms in 2d4 days. He can be permanently destroyed only when active, by a humanoid embracing and calming him. This requires succeeding at DC 28 Diplomacy checks for 3 consecutive rounds.
