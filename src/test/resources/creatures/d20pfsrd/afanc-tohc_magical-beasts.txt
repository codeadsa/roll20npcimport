SPECIAL ABILITIES
Sea Swell (Ex) As a full-round action, an afanc can raise the front part of its body out of the water and bring it crashing back down against the surface. This generates massive waves up to 30 feet tall that may capsize boats and ships within 100 feet of the afanc. Boats and ships less than 20 feet long automatically capsize. Boats over 20 feet long may or may not capsize depending on the skill of the one piloting the vessel. A character steering or guiding a boat or ship over 20 feet long that succeeds on a DC 37 Profession (sailor) check manages to keep the boat afloat; otherwise it capsizes, spilling its contents into the water. The check DC is Strength-based.
