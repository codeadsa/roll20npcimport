SPECIAL ABILITIES
Throat-Rip (Ex) As a full-round action, a devil dog can deliver a coup de grace against a helpless opponent. If the victim survives the attack, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Opponents killed in this manner cannot be raised, but resurrection, true resurrection, or the like can restore the slain creature to life.
