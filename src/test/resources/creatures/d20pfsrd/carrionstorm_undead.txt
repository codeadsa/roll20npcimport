SPECIAL ABILITIES
Pallid Bond (Ex) A carrionstorm never initiates an attack on a creature that openly wears a holy symbol to an evil god or that is itself undead. If attacked first by such a creature, the carrionstorm’s swarm attack deals only 1d3 points of damage to that creature rather than the usual 1d6 points.
Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex) A carrionstorm takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive energy.
