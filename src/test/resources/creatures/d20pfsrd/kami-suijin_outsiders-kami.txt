SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) When a suijin uses its breath weapon, it unleashes a pressurized blast of water that knocks over and soaks everything in its line of effect. Any creature that is struck by the blast and fails its saving throw is pushed back 10 feet as though bull rushed. For every 5 by which a creature fails its saving throw, it is pushed back an additional 5 feet. This effect also extinguishes any normal fires within the line of effect, as well as magical fires, which are dispelled as though by greater dispel magic. A suijin can choose to have its breath weapon deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage before using this ability.
Whitewater Barrier (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a suijin can create a wall of turbulent water. A suijin can make this barrier however long it wishes, up to a maximum length of 180 feet, and the wall is 20 feet tall. A whitewater barrier acts as a sheet of stormy water, and any Large or smaller creature that attempts to pass through the barrier must succeed at a DC 26 Swim check or be rushed to the top of the wave and pushed back to the side it started on, taking fall damage as appropriate. It is possible to create cylindrical or square whitewater barriers to enclose specific points. This effect acts like wind wall in regard to how ranged missiles, breath weapons, gases, and creatures in gaseous form interact with it. The Swim DC is Constitution-based.
