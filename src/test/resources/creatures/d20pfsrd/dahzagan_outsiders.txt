SPECIAL ABILITIES
Heart-Feaster (Su) As a full-round action, a dahzagan can rip out and devour the heart of an orc or half-orc who died in battle within the past 24 hours.
The strength of the dead warrior empowers her, granting her the effects of rage (CL 9th).
Terrifying Howl (Su) A dahzagan can use the terrifying howl barbarian rage power as a standard action (Will DC 19). A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that dahzagan’s terrifying howl for 24 hours.
Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although dahzagans are Large, their upper bodies are those of Medium orcs. As such, they wield weapons as Medium creatures.
