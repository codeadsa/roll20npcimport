SPECIAL ABILITIES
Beast Form (Su) When angered or intoxicated, a baccae takes on a beast-like visage, growing sharpened fangs and claws. This transformation cannot be ended voluntarily and lasts for up to 1 hour.
Charming Gaze (Su) In human form, a baccae’s gaze can charm any creature meeting her gaze and within 30 feet. An affected creature can attempt a DC 14 Will save to resist the effects. If the save fails, the opponent acts as if affected by a charm person spell (caster level equals the baccae’s HD). A baccae can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Rage (Su) Once per day, a baccae in beast form can fly into berserk frenzy. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds). In this rage, she gains temporary bonuses to her ability scores: +4 Strength, +4 Constitution. She likewise gains a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. A baccae cannot voluntarily end her rage.
