SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frightful Charge (Su) A hadhayosh can inspire terror by charging. A creature charged by a hadhayosh must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or become paralyzed with fear, remaining in that condition as long as they stay within 60 feet of the hadhayosh. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Godforged Horns (Ex) A hadhayoshâ€™s horns are treated as silver and cold iron for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Heat (Ex) A hadhayosh generates so much heat that its mere touch deals 1d6 fire damage. A hadhayosh controls the heat it emits, allowing it to carry riders without harming them.
Rush (Ex) Once per minute, the hadhayhosh can move at a speed of 150 feet.
