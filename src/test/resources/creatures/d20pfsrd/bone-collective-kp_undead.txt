SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alternate Form (Ex) A bone collective can act as a swarm (composed of dozens of posthumes), or it can grant a single member (called an exarch) control, acting as a singular creature. Changing between forms is a swift action. In its non-swarm form, the collective can no longer use swarm attacks, but it can use sneak attack, disarm, and spellcasting, if it has caster levels. It can use its skills normally in either form.
Command Undead (Su) Bone collectives gain Command Undead as a bonus feat. For this purpose alone, they are considered to be clerics (cleric level equals HD) with the channel negative energy class feature.
Hive Mind (Ex) All posthumes of a bone collective within 50 miles of their main body constantly communicate. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. No posthume in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are. Any bone collective with at least 1 hp/HD (or 18 hp for a standard collective) forms a hive mind, giving it an Intelligence of 14. (This is an exception to the usual swarm rules.) When a collective goes below this hp threshold, it becomes mindless.
Poison (Ex) Bone collectives distill minerals and cave dragon blood with elements of deadmind poison to create a reddish toxin, called wyrmblood venom, which they smear on their fangs. The resulting freakish red mouths on tiny skeletons are somewhat disturbing, and the effect of the toxin is deadly.
Injury—bite; save Fort DC 22; onset 1 round; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Cha; cure 2 saves.
Superior Disarm (Ex) With their dozens of tiny fingers, bone collectives are exceptionally adept at grabbing or turning aside a weapon and disarming foes. They gain a +2 bonus to any disarm attempt and always wind up with a foe’s weapon in their hands if they succeed.
