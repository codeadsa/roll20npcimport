TACTICS
Before Combat The Herald prefers to let her alluring scent seduce her opponents. If she anticipates a battle she uses cat’s grace on herself.
During Combat If facing weaker opponents that aren’t a threat to her, the Herald likes to use rage to end the battle quickly. Against more dangerous opponents, she uses suggestion to send enemy spellcasters away from the battle, crushing despair to weaken melee fighters, summon swarm or insect plague to harass ranged attackers, and dimension door to avoid being flanked or captured.
Morale The Herald is willing to surrender or flee if necessary, as she knows that sometimes vengeance must wait for the right opportunity.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alluring Scent (Ex) The Herald of Passion’s subtle aroma causes creatures in her vicinity to become placid and react favorably toward her. Any creature that fails a DC 25 Fortitude save against the aura improves its attitude toward the Herald of Passion one step closer to friendly. Creatures with the scent ability take a –4 penalty on this saving throw. Creatures in the aura must attempt a saving throw each minute. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The DC is Constitution-based.
Implant (Ex) Once per day, the Herald of Passion can implant eggs in a creature using its sting. The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist implantation. The target is nauseated for the next 2d4 rounds while the eggs gestate. When the eggs hatch, they form a chaotic neutral hellwasp swarm, kill the host in 1 round, and inhabit the corpse. The eggs can be surgically removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success) or by remove disease or similar spells. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Mind Control (Ex) The Herald of Passion can inject its scent into the brain of a helpless or willing target, controlling it for the next 24 hours (as the spell dominate person, Fortitude DC 25 negates), although the Herald of Passion must verbally give the target instructions. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
