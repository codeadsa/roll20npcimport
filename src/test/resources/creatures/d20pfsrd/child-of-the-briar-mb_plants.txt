SPECIAL ABILITIES
Briar Magic (Sp) A child of the briar can cast any cantrip from the sorcerer/wizard spell list (save DCs Cha-based).
Entangle (Ex) As a standard action, two or more children of the briar in the same square can produce an effect identical to entangle in the 5-ft. square they occupy (DC 10 + number of children of the briar in the square). Briar children are immune to this ability, but other entangle effects affect them normally.
Fey Blood (Ex) Children of the briar count as both plant and fey for any effect related to type.
Spitdart Tongue (Ex) Every child of the briar can shoot a wooden spike from its mouth every other round. Treat this as a Tiny dart (1 damage, base range 20 ft.).
Thorny Grapple (Ex) A child of the briar’s long thorny limbs enable it to grapple creatures up to 2 size categories larger than itself. It adds its Dexterity modifier instead of Strength modifier to any damage inflicted while grappling.
