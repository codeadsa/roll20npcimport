SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a vrykolakas’s natural attacks becomes a vrykolakas itself in 1d4 days if not blessed and properly buried. A blessing might entail either the spell bless or a more mundane consecration. A vrykolakas’s spawn are free-willed and wild, typically remembering nothing of their moment of death and caring nothing for the vrykolakas that killed them. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Horrid Visage (Su) At the mere sight of a vrykolakas, the viewer must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same vrykolakas’s horrid visage for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Feed (Su) When a person dies due to a vrykolakas’ pestilence, the vrykolakas steals some of their lifeforce. For every 5 victims, it gains 1 Hit Die, but only once per week, when it must spend a day of repose at its burial site.
Feral Possession (Ex) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a vrykolakas’s spirit attempts to possess any animal within 100 feet. This ability is similar to the spell magic jar but does not require a receptacle and has a duration equal to 1 hour for every Hit Die the vrykolakas possesses. The target must make a DC 21 Will save or be possessed. If the possession fails, the vrykolakas immediately dies. If the possession succeeds, the animal immediately retreats to the vrykolakas’s grave, where it attempts to bury itself in the earth. If left uninterrupted for 1d4 days, the animal transforms into a new vrykolakas with all the same statistics as the original. If discovered and slain during this time, both the animal and the vrykolakas spirit are destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Pestilent Aura (Su) All creatures that come within 5 feet of a vrykolakas must save to resist contracting bubonic plague. Any creature that successfully saves against a vrykolakas’s pestilent aura cannot be affected by the aura of that same vrykolakas for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Bubonic Plague: aura—inhaled; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and 1 Cha damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.
