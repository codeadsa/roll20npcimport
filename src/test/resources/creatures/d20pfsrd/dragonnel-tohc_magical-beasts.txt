TACTICS
A dragonnel prefers to attack from the air, flying above its prey and then plunging to strike with its claws and bite. A solitary dragonnel is usually either hunting or returning to its lair from hunting, while more than one dragonnel usually indicates a mated pair or family. In such a case, all dragonnels attack in concert with one another and usually fight to the death.
