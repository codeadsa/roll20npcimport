SPECIAL ABILITIES
Displacement (Su) Even when visible, the missing creature appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment.
However, unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals the creatureâ€™s location accurately.
Evasion (Ex) A missing creature can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If it makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage. A helpless missing creature does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Invisibility (Su) Whenever the creature does not attack for 1 full round, it becomes invisible as a free action. In addition to becoming visible if it attacks, the missing creature becomes visible if it takes hit point damage. If made visible by this second method, the missing creature becomes invisible again at the beginning of its next turn (though it might immediately become visible by attacking on that turn).
Shadowed (Su) A missing creature gains a +3 bonus to Stealth, and it can make Stealth checks even when observed or in normal or bright light.
