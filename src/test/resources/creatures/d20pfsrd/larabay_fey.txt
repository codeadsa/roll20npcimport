SPECIAL ABILITIES
Befuddling Gaze (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a larabay can employ a befuddling gaze attack in a 30-foot cone. Creatures that fail a DC 21 Will save become dazed for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Mischief (Su) A larabay can channel its magical energy through whatever one-handed weapon it wields to mystify and disorient foes. Creatures hit by a larabay’s weapon must make a DC 21 Will save or take 1 point of Dexterity damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
