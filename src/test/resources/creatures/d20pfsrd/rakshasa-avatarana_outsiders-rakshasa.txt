SPECIAL ABILITIES
Absolute Independence (Ex) An avatarana is immune to all charm and compulsion spells and effects as well as magic jar, possession, and similar spells and abilities.
Corporeal Possession (Su) As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an avatarana can meld its body into that of a pinned, helpless, or willing humanoid creature adjacent to it. Seeping in through the victim’s skin like mercury, the avatarana usurps control of the body as if it controlled the target via greater possession. When the avatarana leaves the possessed body, it reappears in a free space of its choice adjacent to the victim.
