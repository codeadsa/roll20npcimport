SPECIAL ABILITIES
Magic Circle against Evil (Su) This ability continually duplicates the effect of the spell. The unicorn cannot suppress this ability.

Magical Strike (Ex) A unicorn’s gore attack is treated as a magic good weapon for the purposes of damage reduction.

Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid’s wild empathy class feature, except the unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check. Unicorns with druid levels add this racial modifier to their wild empathy checks.
