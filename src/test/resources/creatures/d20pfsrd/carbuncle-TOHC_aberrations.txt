SPECIAL ABILITIES
Discord (Su) As a standard action, a carbuncle can sow discord in a creature within 30 feet using its telepathy ability. It can use this ability once per round to affect one creature. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Foresight (Su) A carbuncle has a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This ability is always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.
