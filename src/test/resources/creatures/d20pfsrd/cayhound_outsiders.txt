SPECIAL ABILITIES
Righteous Bite (Su) A cayhound’s bite is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Thunderous Bark (Su) Once every 1d6 rounds, a cayhound can bark with the concussive force of a thunderbolt. Every creature within a 15-foot cone-shaped burst must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 3d8 points of sonic damage and be knocked prone. A successful saving throw reduces this damage by half and negates being knocked prone. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Unbound (Su) Cayhounds move as if under a continuous freedom of movement spell. They are immune to dimensional anchor, but are affected by dimensional lock normally.
