SPECIAL ABILITIES
Flaming Body (Su) A brijidine’s body is molten rock covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a brijidine with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a brijidine or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.
Heat Stone (Su) Whenever a brijidine uses her meld into stone, soften earth and stone, spike stones, stone shape, or wall of stone spell-like abilities, she can have the affected stone radiate intense heat for 1 minute. Any creature within 5 feet of the stone takes 1d6 fire damage per round.
Lava Blast (Su) A brijidine can hurl a glob of lava at a target as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 30 feet.
Obsidian Blade (Ex) At will as a free action, a brijidine can create a blade of jagged volcanic glass that functions as a +1 flaming burst keen longsword. One round after it leaves the brijidine’s grasp, the weapon decays into useless powder.
