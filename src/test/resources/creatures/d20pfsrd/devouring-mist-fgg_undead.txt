SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Drain (Ex) Creatures in the devouring mist’s space at the end of its movement each round take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as it siphons blood out of the victim’s body. For every point so drained, the devouring mist heals 5 hit points of damage. Creatures without blood take no damage from the devouring mist.
Create Spawn (Su) Any creature slain by a devouring mist rises as a vampire spawn in 1d4 days, unless the remains are blessed. If the victim had more than 5 hit dice, there is a 1% chance per hit die that it arises as a full-fledged vampire instead, or a 5% chance per hit die if the victim was of the humanoid type.
Editor’s Note
Improved Channel Resistance? Yeah, we can’t find it either. Appears to improve channel resistance. Go figure.
