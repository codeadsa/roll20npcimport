TACTICS

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Quills (Ex) When the dire porcupine strikes with its tail, it dislodges 1d6 quills that automatically break off and lodge in the opponent’s flesh. A lodged quill imposes a –1 circumstance penalty to attacks, saves, and checks. Each 1 minute thereafter, the quill moves deeper into the opponent’s flesh, dealing 1d2 additional points of damage. Removing the quill takes 1 full round and deals 1d4 additional points of damage. If the quill has been embedded for more than 10 rounds, a Strength check at DC 10 is needed to remove the quill. For every minute after that, the DC to remove a lodged quill increases by +1. An unarmed or melee touch attack against a dire porcupine causes 1d4 quills to break off and lodge in the attacker.
