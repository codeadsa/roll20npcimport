SPECIAL ABILITIES
Pierce (Ex) As a free action, a crag man can transform its hands into stony points. When striking with its hands in this manner, it deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning with its slam attack.
Stalagmite Form (Ex) Once per round as a swift action a crag man can transform itself to or from the form of a stalagmite of equivalent size. This stalagmite is the crag man’s natural form; while in this form it does not radiate magic and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid form.
