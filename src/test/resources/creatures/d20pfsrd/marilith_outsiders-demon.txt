SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crushing Coils (Ex) A creature that takes damage from a marilith’s constrict attack must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for 1d8 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
Infuse Weapon (Su) Any weapon a marilith wields gains a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and strikes as if it were a chaotic and evil cold iron weapon (in addition to retaining the qualities of its actual composition).
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A marilith never takes penalties to her attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.
