SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animate Hair (Su) A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows:
Size Time
Up to Tiny 1 round
Small or Medium 2 rounds
Large 3 rounds
A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th)
Laugh (Su) Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures that hear it within 60 feet for 1d2 rounds. A DC 14 Will save negates the effects. A bard‘s countersong ability allows a stunned creature a new Will save to break free. Whether the save is successful or not, a creature is immune to the laugh of the same korred for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
