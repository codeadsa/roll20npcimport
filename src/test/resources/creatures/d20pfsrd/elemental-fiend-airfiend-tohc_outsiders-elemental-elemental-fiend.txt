SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) An elemental fiend’s three faces allow it to see in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
Shock (Ex) An airfiend deals electricity damage in addition to damage dealt on a successful hit in melee. Those affected by the shock ability must also succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be shocked, taking 1d6 electricity damage for an additional 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn. A shocked creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. Creatures that hit an airfiend with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take electricity damage as though hit by the airfiend. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Willful Weapon (Su) A disarmed elemental fiend can will its weapon to return to its hand on its turn as a free action, as long as the weapon is within 30 ft. of the elemental fiend and is in its line of sight and line of effect. The weapon automatically returns to the elemental fiend’s hand even if the weapon is being held by another creature.
