SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Ex) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. All creatures within a 30-ft radius take 10d6 damage. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces it to half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 19 Reflex save or take 2d8 fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based.
