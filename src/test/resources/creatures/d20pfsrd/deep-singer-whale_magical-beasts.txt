SPECIAL ABILITIES
Entrancing Harmonies (Su) The music of a deep singer whale is of such beauty that it can entrance all who hear it. After one full round of singing, all those within 1,000 feet who can hear the song must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or stop what they are doing and simply listen. Entranced creatures that suffer damage get a new save, with a bonus equal to the damage inflicted. The entrancing effect lasts for as long as the whale sings, and a deep singer whale can maintain an entrancing harmony for as long as it has air. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A deep singer whale can cast spells as a bard of a level equal to half their hit dice, rounded down. The components for these spells are always verbal only.
Pressure Immunity (Ex) A deep singer whale is immune to pressure damage at any depth.
