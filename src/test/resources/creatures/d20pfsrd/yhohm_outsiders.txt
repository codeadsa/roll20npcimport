SPECIAL ABILITIES
Holy Fire (Su) Like a flame strike, half the fire damage from a yhohm’s fire attacks is fire damage; the other half is divine power and is not subject to fire immunity or resistance.
Self-Resurrection (Su) A slain yhohm remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed yhohm emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The yhohm gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs. A yhohm can self-resurrect only once per year. If a yhohm dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A yhohm that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the yhohm immediately resurrects. A yhohm brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.
Shroud of Flame (Su) A yhohm can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within 5 feet must attempt a DC 14 Reflex save each round or take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the yhohm with a natural or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.
