SPECIAL ABILITIES
Anchor (Ex) As a move action, a seahorse can wrap its tail around a stationary object. The seahorse remains anchored to the object until it releases its grip (a free action) or is forcibly moved. An anchored seahorse gains a +4 bonus to its combat maneuver defense and on checks and saving throws against effects that would move it against its will.
