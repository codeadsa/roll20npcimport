SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spiky Skin (Ex) An earth yai may grow spikes from its stony skin at will as a free action. These spikes are treated as armor spikes that deal 1d10 points of damage.
Stony Missile (Su) As a swift action, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range increment, and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Upon striking the target, the stone immediately makes an Awesome Blow attempt against the target using the earth yai’s CMB.
