SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bloodsense (Ex) A Jupiter bloodsucker can detect any living creature that has blood in its body to a range of 60 feet by scent.
Smother (Ex) By making a successful grapple check (with a +2 bonus for every vine-leaf attached to a foe at the beginning of its turn), a Jupiter bloodsucker can cover a grappled opponent’s nose and mouth. An opponent caught in this way must hold its breath or begin suffocating. A vineleaf attached in this way does not drain blood.
