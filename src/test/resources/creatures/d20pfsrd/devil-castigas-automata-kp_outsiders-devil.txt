SPECIAL ABILITIES
Demented Punishment (Su) The whip wielded by an automata devil extrudes tiny hair-like filaments, which cause excruciating agony. Targets entangled by the whip are affected by a symbol of pain (DC 20, Cha-based); this only affects the entangled creature. This attack can only be used every other round by each whip.
Entangle (Ex) An automata devil‘s whip entangles foes much like a net. The whip has 15 hp and hardness 5. If it hits, the target and the automata devil make opposed Strength checks. If the automata devil wins, the whip drags the opponent into its punishing embrace.
Fear Aura (Su) Automata devils radiate fear in a 5 ft. radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 20 Will save (Cha-based) or be affected by fear. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same automata devil’s fear aura. Devils and kytons are immune to the effect.
Lacerate (Ex) An automata devil deals automatic maw damage with a successful CMB check.
Punishing Embrace (Ex) Creatures grappled by the automata devil‘s whip are thrown into its stomach maw, freeing the whip for the next attack. The maw is a mass of churning gears with serrated edges, clockwork gears, and whirling blades. An automata devil can make a grapple check as a free action against opponents drawn into the maw. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, the automata devil it establishes hold and can lacerate.
