SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Trap (Su) Once per week, a gearghost can create a trap of CR 4 or lower regardless of cost, materials, or skill checks. Two or more gearghosts working together on a trap can increase the maximum CR by 2 for each additional gearghost working in concert. For example, three gearghosts working together can create any CR 8 or lower trap in a week.
Rejuvenation (Su) A destroyed gearghost reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a gearghost, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow spell. To complete the destruction, every trap within 100 feet of the remains must be successfully disabled or destroyed before the gearghost is completely destroyed.
Resetter (Ex) A gearghost can reset traps and keep them repaired with supernatural efficiency. A gearghost can reset a trap with a repair or manual reset as a move action. If a trap has an automatic reset that is longer than immediate, a gearghost can reset that trap as a free action.
