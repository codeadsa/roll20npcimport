SQ rider bond
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rider Bond (Su) A dragonkin can form a magical bond with its rider that lasts until death.
Forming this bond requires a special ritual that takes 1 hour.
Once a dragonkin forms this bond, it can’t form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its bonded rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. When a rider is mounted on his dragonkin at the start of combat, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result.
