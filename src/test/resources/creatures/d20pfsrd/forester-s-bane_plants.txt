SPECIAL ABILITIES
Snap and Saw (Ex) A forester’s bane can saw at an opponent, dealing slashing damage, when it makes a successful grapple check. This attack deals 1d4+3 points of slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester’s bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than itself. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves).
Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a forester’s bane’s leaf or stalk does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a target, the forester’s bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester’s bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester’s bane is not killed.
