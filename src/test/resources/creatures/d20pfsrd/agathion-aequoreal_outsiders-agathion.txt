SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dream Link (Su) As a standard action, an aequoreal can slide its body over a Medium or smaller creature’s head and link minds. This allows the linked creature to communicate telepathically and share dreams with the aequoreal as well as with any other beings whose forehead is currently touched by its tentacles. Dream link does not inhibit a creature’s breathing ability.
Hollow Body (Ex) An aequoreal’s hollow body collapses easily to absorb blunt force. Bludgeoning damage in excess of an aequoreal’s damage reduction is converted to nonlethal damage.
Mnemostat (Su) The stinging cells of an aequoreal can transfer a shocking jolt of electricity and memory into the minds of its target. Evil creatures take 1d4 electricity damage. Evil and neutral creatures are stunned for 1d3 rounds (DC 13) by the rush of confusing and guilt-inducing memories. Good creatures take no damage and are instead affected as by calm emotions (DC 13). This ability can be used once every 1d4 rounds.
