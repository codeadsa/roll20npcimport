SPECIAL ABILITIES
Luminescence (Ex) The chemicals within cavelight moss cause the entire creature to glow and shed light as a torch. A cavelight moss cannot suppress this effect. It can, however, diminish the light produced to shed illumination as a candle.
Strength Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by a cavelight moss’s tendril attack or caught up in its grapple must succeed on a DC 20 Fort saving throw (Con-based) or take 1d6 Strength drain. A creature that makes its Fort save is immune to that particular cavelight moss’s Strength drain ability for 24 hours. On each successful attack, a cavelight moss gains 5 temporary hp.
