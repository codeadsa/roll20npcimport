SPECIAL ABILITIES
Illusory Retreat (Sp) A drelb can rapidly diminish its form while it advances forward. To the onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding on a DC 20 Will save see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb advances into melee range and its opponent is considered flat-footed for the drelb’s next attack following the use of this ability. A creature that has seen a drelb use this ability before gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.
Nether Chill (Su) A living creature touched by a drelb must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or immediately drops anything it is holding and fall prone, shivering for 1 round. It is not helpless but is unable to make any actions during this round. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for the drelb’s Ability Focus feat.
Psionic Adaptation (Su) A drelb can imitate any psionic power or psi-like ability used within 30 feet of it as a standard action. A drelb has a manifester level of 5th. The save DC (if any) to resist an imitated psionic power or psi-like ability is 12 + the level of the power. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Further, any psionic power or psi-like ability that directly targets a drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect (manifester level and save DC equal to that of the original manifester).
