SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison Use (Ex) Buckawns never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade. They favor moonseed berries as poison and usually have a plentiful supply readily available.
These small berries are bluish-purple and resemble wild grapes. They are highly poisonous and are often mixed with food or crushed and smeared on a weapon or object.
Moonseed Berries: poison—contact or ingested; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save; Price 1,500 gp.
