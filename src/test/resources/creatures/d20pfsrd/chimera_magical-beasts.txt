SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A chimera’s breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a chimera’s breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 6d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
To determine a chimera’s head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below:
d10 Head Color Breath Weapon
1–2 Black 40-foot line of acid
3–4 Blue 40-foot line of lightning
5–6 Green 20-foot cone of acid
7–8 Red 20-foot cone of fire
9–10 White 20-foot cone of cold
