SPECIAL ABILITIES
Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an elemental air dragon.
Breath Weapon (Su) An elemental air dragon’s breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of superheated air.
Cyclone (Ex) By beating its wings rapidly back and forth, a hovering elemental air dragon can create a cyclonelike force of wind in a 30-foot radius around its body. This cyclone has the following effects: movement through the cyclone is one-quarter normal, ranged attacks suffer a –8 circumstance penalty in the area, and all non-magical unprotected flames are automatically extinguished. Large or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round they remain in the area. Medium or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a second Reflex save (same DC) or be knocked prone and back 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Flying creatures are automatically grounded in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.
