SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Knell (Su) 5/day; Will DC 25. The save DC is Charisma–based.
Greater Death Knell (Su) 1/month; Will DC 25. The save DC is Charisma–based.
Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a deathleech horned devil deals with its tail causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to staunch—a DC 26 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.
Stun (Su) Whenever a deathleech horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 28 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. The save DC is Strength–based.
