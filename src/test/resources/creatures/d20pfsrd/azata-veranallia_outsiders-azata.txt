SPECIAL ABILITIES
Autumnal Embrace (Su) At will, a veranallia can strike any creature within 30 feet barren or sterile. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it had to reproduce or bear children. This effect can only be removed by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that magically reproduce are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Rebirth (Su) Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature’s original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a 1/2-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as the reincarnate spell.
Spell Casting Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics and have access to some druid spells. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
Winter Sickle (Ex) At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia’s grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.
