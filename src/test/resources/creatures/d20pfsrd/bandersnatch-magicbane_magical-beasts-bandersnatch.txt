SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura (Sp) Magicbane bandersnatches radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a free action on the bandersnatch’s next turn.
Bounding Charge (Ex) A magicbane bandersnatch can move through difficult terrain when it charges.
Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a magicbane bandersnatch’s tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap. A magicbane bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on attack rolls when using its tail slap.
Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a magicbane bandersnatch can make a single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A magicbane bandersnatch cannot lash out on the same round it charges.
Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a magicbane bandersnatch’s tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Planar Acclimation (Ex) A magicbane bandersnatch is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a magicbane bandersnatch with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d10* points of piercing damage from the bandersnatch’s quills and suffers from the bandersnatch’s pain attack.
Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a magicbane bandersnatch can loose a volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during which the bandersnatch’s defensive abilities are unaffected.
Relentless Tracker (Ex) A magicbane bandersnatch can move at up to double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track creatures it has wounded.
