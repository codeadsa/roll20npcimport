SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devour Soul (Su) A living creature slain by an entropic ooze has its soul devoured by the ooze. Such a creature cannot be returned to life until the entropic ooze that contains its soul is slain.
Soulsight (Su) An entropic ooze can automatically detect the location of any living creature within 120 feet. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
