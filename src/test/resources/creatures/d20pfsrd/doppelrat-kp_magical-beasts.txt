SPECIAL ABILITIES
Arcane Mitosis (Su) A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. Each duplicate appears in the same square as any other rat, can take a move or standard action the round it appears, and has 1/4 the main rat’s current hp (minimum 1). After the last multiplication of rats, all surviving clones perish in 8 rounds. If the original doppelrat dies, its arcane mitosis ends, but the clones remain for 8 rounds. A doppelrat may not use this ability until 10 minutes have passed from the previous use.
Disease (Ex) Degenerate cloning—injury; save Fort DC 11; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage, 1d3 Con damage, and the victim becomes shaken for 1 hour (Will DC 11); cure 2 consecutive saves. Doppelrats created through arcane mitosis can also transmit this disease.
