SPECIAL ABILITIES
Boiling Bite (Su) At old age, a mist dragon’s bite deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. An ancient dragon’s damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym’s to 6d6.
Breath Weapon (Su) A mist dragon’s breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a radius equal to the cone’s length; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the blindness spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 2 rounds after they leave the area.
Mist Form (Su) As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume gaseous form, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon’s abilities while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage. As a full-round action, a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can attack with its breath weapon.
Mist Vision (Ex) A very young mist dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist).
Water Breathing (Ex) A very young or older mist dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
