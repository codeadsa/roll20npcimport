SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A stone pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and stone, but not metal. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.
Furthermore, clothing, leather armor, and stone and wooden weapons dissolve upon contact, immediately becoming useless. A DC 21 Reflex saving throw, negates. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The pudding’s acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or stone objects (including creatures it has turned to stone), but the pudding must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
Petrifying Touch (Su) A stone pudding’s touch attacks turn opponents to stone permanently. Fortitude save DC 21 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Racial Vulnerability (Ex) A stone pudding is slowed (as by a slow spell) for 3 rounds if stone to flesh is cast on it. The stone pudding does not receive a save against this effect.
