SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) The wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing’s 10-foot long eyestalks allow it to look in any direction, thereby granting it a +4 racial bonus on vision-based Perception skill checks. A wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing cannot be flanked.
Lure-Growth (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing can sprout a small furry animal from its stump as a free action. It uses this ability to lure potential prey into range where it then attacks with its tentacles. A creature viewing the lure-growth must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom check to detect the deception. The check DC is Constitution-based.
