SPECIAL ABILITIES
Negative Energy Aura (Ex) Being composed of negative energy, a netherspark radiates an aura of such energy in a 10-foot radius. Any living creature within this area takes 1 point of damage per round until it leaves the area. Undead in the area heal 1 hit point each round they remain in the area. Undead cannot more hit points than their normal total from the nethersparkâ€™s aura.
Negative Energy Burst (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a netherspark can release a burst of negative energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Creatures in the area take 1d8+10 points of negative energy damage. Undead take no damage but heal a number of hit points equal to what the ray would otherwise deal.
Negative Energy Ray (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a netherspark can release a ray of negative energy with a range of 40 feet as a ranged touch attack. A target hit takes gains one negative level if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. On a successful save, the target avoids the negative level but still takes 1d8 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
