SPECIAL ABILITIES
Digestive Enzymes (Ex) A belostomatid injects a corrosive enzyme into its prey that both paralyzes and liquefies flesh. A creature struck by the belostomatid’s piercing bite must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. For every round the creature is paralyzed it takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage.
Hold Breath (Ex) A belostomatid can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
