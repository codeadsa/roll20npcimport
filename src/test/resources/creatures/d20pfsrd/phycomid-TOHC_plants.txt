SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A phycomid’s fluid globules are formed of acid. Any ranged touch attack deals 1d6 points of acid damage.
Spore Infection (Ex) A creature hit by a phycomid’s fluid globule attack must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage as tiny mushroom-like growths sprout from its body. Each minute (10 rounds) thereafter, until the victim receives a remove disease, heal, miracle, or wish, he takes 1 point of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the victim dies and his body collapses to the ground, sprouting a new phycomid. The save DC is Constitution-based.
