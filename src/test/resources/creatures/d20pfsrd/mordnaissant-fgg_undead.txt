SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Curse (Su) As a final cruel jest to the individual that puts a mordnaissant out of its misery, the slayer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer from a terrible curse that reduces all subsequent experience points awarded by 50%. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Lash of Fury (Su) The mordnaissant can lash out with its negative energy powers and directly attack the vitality of living creatures, in the form of a twisting stream of black energy. The mordnaissant must make a ranged touch attack against its target as an attack action. If the ray hits, the victim must make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage or duration, depending on the specific effect chosen by the mordnaissant. The save DC is Charismabased.
The lash of fury has a range of 30 ft. with no range increment.
The mordnaissant can pick from three possible lashes; it must make its choice prior to rolling the attack. The three options are:
whip the flesh (as inflict moderate wounds, 2d8+9 damage), whip the mind (1d4 points of Intelligence damage), or whip the soul (stun 1d4+1 rounds). A critical hit doubles the damage rolled or the duration, in the case of whip the soul. Lifesense (Su) A mordnaissant notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
Pain Wail (Su) As a swift action, the mordnaissant can produce a terrible wailing sound that reflects the pain it experiences every moment of its existence. All living creatures within 20 ft. must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for one round. For every 20 points of damage the mordnaissant takes, the save DC increases by +1.
Shield of Agony (Su) A mordnaissant harnesses the pain of its existence to shield it. It adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC and CMD.
