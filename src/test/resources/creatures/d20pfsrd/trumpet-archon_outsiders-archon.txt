SPECIAL ABILITIES
Trumpet (Su)
All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the trumpet’s blast must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. The archon can also command its trumpet to become a +4 greatsword as a free action. Out of the archon’s hands, it is a chunk of useless metal.
Spellcasting Trumpet archons can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
