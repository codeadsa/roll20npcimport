SPECIAL ABILITIES
Anathema (Su) A debased fey has been rejected by the purity of nature. Normal plants within 20 feet wither and die if the debased fey remains in proximity for more than 5 minutes. Pure environments such as untouched forests and clear streams and ponds may become spoiled and polluted if the debased fey remains in that environment for more than 1 day. Plant creatures (such as shambling mounds, for example) take 1d2 points of damage each round they remain within 20 feet of a debased fey. A Fortitude save negates the damage for that round. A new save can be made each round.
Defiling Touch (Su) The damage dealt by a debased fey’s natural attacks resists all magical healing (though it can be healed normally through rest). A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a creature damaged by a debased fey’s natural attacks must make a successful caster level check (DC 10 + 1/2 the debased fey’s HD + the debased fey’s Constitution modifier, +2 racial bonus), or the spell has no effect on the injured creature.
Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid’s wild empathy class feature, except that a nixie has a +6 racial bonus on the check.
