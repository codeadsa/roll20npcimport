SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Wood (Ex) A woodwose is unaffected by wooden weapons (such as clubs or quarterstaffs) and spells or effects that generate or use wood-type effects (such as a wall of thorns for example). Weapons with damaging parts that are primarily metal (or some other material) such as arrows, spears, and so on, damage a woodwose normally.
Plant Passivism (Ex) No plant creatures willingly attack a woodwose. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If attacked by a woodwose or one of its allies, the effect is broken and the plant creature can attack the woodwose normally.
Plantsense (Ex) A woodwose can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with vegetation.
Spells A woodwose casts spells as a 9th-level druid.
Spines (Ex) As a free action, a woodwose can cause sharpened wooden spines to protrude from its body. Any creature in contact with the woodwose or grappling with it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round it remains in contact with the woodwose. In addition, any creature attacking a woodwose with natural weapons or unarmed attacks takes the same 1d6 points of damage.
