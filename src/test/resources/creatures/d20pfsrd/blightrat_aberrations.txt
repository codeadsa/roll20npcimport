SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Disease Vulnerability (Su) A creature within a blightrat’s 30-foot aura of disease vulnerability that is not immune to disease must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 23) or suffer a –8 penalty to all saving throws against disease for 1d4 minutes. A creature affected by this ability multiple times increases the penalty by –2 each time. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Blightbite Disease (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 27, onset 1d2 days, frequency 1 day, effect 1d4 Charisma damage, cure 2 consecutive saves. The diseased creature’s hair falls out in small clumps every day the save is failed. A creature with little hair, such as an elf or human, loses all of its hair after 2d3 days of failed saving throws. Hairier creatures, such as dwarves, lose all their hair after 2d6 days. Creatures with fur, such as catfolk and ratfolk, have no hair left after 2d10 days. Remove disease has no effect on this ability; only limited wish or more powerful magic will remove the disease. A creature that loses hair or fur from this disease begins to regrow its hair 1d2 weeks after the disease ends. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Nauseating Disease (Su) Claw—injury; save Fort DC 27, onset 1d3 days, frequency 1 day, effect 1d3 Constitution damage plus nauseated, cure 2 consecutive saves. A successful remove disease attempt removes the nauseated condition for the day; it has no other effect on this ability. Only limited wish or more powerful magic will remove the disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poweful Bite (Ex) A blightrat’s bite attack naturally has a critical threat range of 18–20.
