SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dooming Gaze (Su) Paralyzed with fear for 1 round, 60 feet, Will DC 27 negates. A creature that is already paralyzed by this gaze attack and fails a saving throw to resist being paralyzed for 1 more round gains 1 negative level (Fortitude DC 27 to remove after 24 hours). The paralysis effect of this gaze is a mind-affecting fear effect, but the negative level is not. The save DC is Charisma-based.
