SPECIAL ABILITIES
Captivating Cloud (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a viper vine can emit a transparent cloud of pollen in a 60-foot spread that has the power to lull the minds of those that smell it. Once activated, the cloud persists for 5 rounds unless dispersed by moderate or stronger wind. All creatures in the cloud must succeed on a DC 24 Will saving throw each round or become captivated. Once a creature becomes captivated, it takes no actions save to approach the viper vine via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim that is attacked by the viper vine gets a new saving throw as a free action during each of the vine’s attacks to overcome the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Cold Lethargy (Ex) Exposure to any cold effect slows a viper vine (as a slow spell) for 1d4 rounds.
