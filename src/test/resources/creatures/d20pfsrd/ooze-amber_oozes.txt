SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ability Drain (Ex) If not purged from the host body, the acids and protoplasm of an amber ooze begin damaging its host’s body and mind. After 1 week, the host takes 1 point each of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain per day. When one of the three abilities reaches 0, the host dies.
Infuse (Ex) A victim that has ingested an amber ooze must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or the amber ooze infuses itself into his body. The ooze merges with flesh and bone, and can only be removed by a remove disease spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. A detect magic (or similar magic) cast on the host reveals the amber ooze.
If the victim succeeds on the Fortitude save, the amber ooze takes 1 point of acid damage per round from the host’s digestive juices. Once it begins to take damage, the ooze retreats from the host’s body through its mouth.
Weaken Will (Su) An amber ooze that has infused itself into a host weakens the will of its victim. As long as the amber ooze remains in the host, he takes a -4 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting spells and effects (such as charm person and suggestion.)
