SPECIAL ABILITIES
Agile (Ex) Void dragons have good aerial maneuverability regardless of their age or size.
Alien Presence (Su) A void dragon’s alien presence causes an opponent that fails its save to be overcome with dizziness, becoming sickened (or nauseated if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.
Obliterate (Su) A young or older void dragon’s bite deals an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to ashes (as the disintegrate spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Suffocating Breath (Su) Instead of dealing cold damage, a very young or older void dragon can breathe a cone-shaped suffocation effect. An air-dependent creature that fails its Fortitude save suffocates for a number of rounds equal to the dragon’s age category. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Void Gaze (Su) A creature within 30 feet of an adult or older void dragon must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
