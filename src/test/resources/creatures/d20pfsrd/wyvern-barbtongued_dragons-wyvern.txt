TACTICS
If they can, the barbtongued wyverns start combat by swooping in to attack the PCs before the party can fully enter a room, limiting melee combat options while still being able to take advantage of their reach to strike at foes farther up the stairs or down a hall.
Barbtongued wyverns fight to the death.
