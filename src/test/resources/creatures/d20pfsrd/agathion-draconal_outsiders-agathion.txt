SPECIAL ABILITIES
Celestial Focus (Ex) A draconal’s color indicates aspects of its power and attunement to the powers of the good planes (see Draconal Colors, below). These determine the draconal’s breath weapon, the additional energy damage of its claw and bite attacks, additional resistances and immunities, and its additional domain choices (see Spells, below).
Divine Insight (Su) A draconal adds its Charisma bonus as an insight bonus to Armor Class.
Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the draconal. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals draconal’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a draconal’s stat block.)
Spells Draconals cast spells as 17th-level clerics. Like clerics, they have access to two domains, selecting from the following list: Air, Good, Nobility, Weather, and two additional domain options based on their color (see below). The majority of draconals choose Good and Nobility as their domains (as represented by this stat block). Draconals have a domain spell slot at each spell level but do not gain the granted powers of their chosen domains, nor do they gain access to other cleric abilities.
