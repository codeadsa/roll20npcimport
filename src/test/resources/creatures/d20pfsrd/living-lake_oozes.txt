SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) A living lake that has grabbed an opponent can try to engulf the creature in its body. This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the living lake’s body, where the ooze inflicts automatic slam damage each round. In addition, an engulfed foe has no air to breathe and must hold its breath or risk drowning. A living lake can engulf 1 Gargantuan, 2 Huge, 8 Large, 16 Medium, 32 Small, 64 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine creatures. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free, living lake simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack.
