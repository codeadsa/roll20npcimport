SPECIAL ABILITIES
Planebound (Ex) An umbral shepherd is inherently tied to the Plane of Shadow, and can’t survive for long on any other plane without a host body. Each round that an umbral shepherd is on another plane without a host body, it takes 1d6 points of damage.
Possession (Su) An umbral shepherd can possess a host body as if using magic jar, save that if its host body is killed while possessed, the shepherd dies as well. An umbral shepherd can attempt a possession anytime it succeeds at a touch attack, even while already in a host body. If the touched creature fails a DC 15 Will save, it becomes possessed. Possession by an umbral shepherd takes a toll on its host body, which takes 1 point of Constitution drain every month it is so possessed. Abandoning a host body requires the umbral shepherd to either take a standard action (to appear in a square adjacent to the host) or make a successful possession attempt on a new host. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shadow Touch (Su) An umbral shepherd that succeeds at a touch attack can attempt to dissolve a portion of the victim’s flesh into shadow, which then dissipates, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Victims that succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save take half damage. The umbral shepherd can use this ability even while possessing a host body. The save DC is Charisma-based.
