SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Su) When a sard dies, its remains explode with a blast of lightning into razor-sharp splinters of wood. All creatures within 30 feet of a sard when it explodes in this manner take 12d6 points of electricity damage and 12d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 31 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Electrical Jolt (Su) Every time a creature strikes a sard with a metal melee weapon, arcs of electricity deal 1d10 points of damage to the attacker.
Planar Acclimation (Ex) A sard is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Poison (Ex) Thorn—injury; save Fort DC 31; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex and 4d6 electricity; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Thorns 8 (Ex) A sard’s thorns have a range of 180 feet with no range increment.
