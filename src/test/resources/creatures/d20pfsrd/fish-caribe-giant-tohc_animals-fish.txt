SPECIAL ABILITIES
Frenzy (Ex) A giant caribe that detects blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy, as do all other giant caribes within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied giant caribes attack until either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied giant caribe can make one extra attack when making a full attack action. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack. Additionally, it gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. A frenzied giant caribe’s swim speed increases by 10 feet. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute and can only be used once per encounter.
Keen Scent (Ex) A giant caribe can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges up to 500 feet.
