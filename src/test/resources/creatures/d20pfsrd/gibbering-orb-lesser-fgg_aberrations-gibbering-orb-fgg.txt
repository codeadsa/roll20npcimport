SPECIAL ABILITIES
Eye Rays (Su) Six of the eyes can produce a magical ray per round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a 14th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than three rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 80 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack.
The default eye rays are: daze monster, dispel magic, flaming sphere, inflict moderate wounds, magic missile, and ray of enfeeblement. The save DC is Charisma-based.
The eye rays listed above are just a default selection for convenience. If you’d like a different assortment of rays, a lesser gibbering orb can have up to 6 eye rays, each based on a 0–3rd level cleric or sorcerer spell. They can simply be chosen by the GM or rolled randomly on the table below.

Flight (Sp) The gibbering orb’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to cast fly, as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 30 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.
Gibbering (Su) As a free action, no more than once per 1d4 rounds, a gibbering orb can emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers and gibbering orbs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same orb’s gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Steal Spell/Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature’s known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any one of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.
