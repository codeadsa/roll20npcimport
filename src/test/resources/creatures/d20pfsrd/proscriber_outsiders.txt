SPECIAL ABILITIES
Condemn (Su) Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Additionally, one that fails its save resists all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature.
The effects of this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the condemned.
