TACTICS
A rawbones attacks primarily with its powerful fists, but it has other weapons at its disposal. It can vomit forth a horrifying spray of blood and gore or use its entrails as a ranged weapon which it loops around an opponent’s neck in an attempt to strangle it. While battling its foes, it attempts to keep them within range of its nauseating aura.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Nauseating Aura (Su) A rawbones emanates a sickening aura that reeks of death in a 20-foot radius. Any creature that comes within that area must succeed on DC 19 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain within the area a 1 minute after leaving the area. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the nauseating aura of that rawbones for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Strangulation (Ex) When a rawbones hits an opponent of up to one size larger with its entrails lash, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it succeeds on its grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage per round in addition to normal damage to the grappled opponent each round that the hold is maintained.
Vomit Gore (Su) Three times per day, a rawbones can spit a blast of blood and gore in a 20-foot cone that deals 7d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
