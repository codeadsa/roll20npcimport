SPECIAL ABILITIES
Vortex (Su) A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability, save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.
Water Mastery (Ex) A marid gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the marid is touching the ground, the marid takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
Water’s Fury (Su) As a standard action, a marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
