TACTICS
Shrouding themselves in a preternatural darkness, fear guards fight using their spell-like abilities and their incorporeal touch. If guarding a particular location, a fear guard fights until either it is slain or driven away, or its opponents are slain or flee. If exposed to natural sunlight, fear guards either surround themselves with magical darkness for protection or flee if this unsuccessful.
