SPECIAL ABILITIES
Limited Flight (Ex) By releasing naturally occurring helium from its body, a diger is able to fly for a number of rounds equal to 1 + 1/2 its current Constitution score (12 rounds for the average diger). After that, it must land and cannot fly again until it has rested for 2 minutes (20 rounds).
Transparent (Ex) A diger is transparent in water. It takes a successful DC 15 Perception check to recognize a motionless diger for what it really is.
