SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spines (Ex) A creature that steps on a dragonfish or strikes it with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage from the fish’s dorsal barbs and is subjected to its poison. Melee weapons do not endanger a user in this way. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a dragonfish. A creature that takes more than 2 points of damage from a dragonfish’s barb has its speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts until the barb is removed.
Dragonfish Poison (Ex) Spine—injury, save Fort DC 11, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d2 Constitution, cure 1 save
Camouflage (Ex) It takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to recognize a motionless dragonfish for what it really is.
