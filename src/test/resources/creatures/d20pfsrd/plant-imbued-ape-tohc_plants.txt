SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acute Senses (Ex) Plant-imbued creatures can instantly sense anything within 60 feet; they cannot be flanked or surprised and gain Improved Uncanny Dodge as if they possessed rogue levels equal to their Hit Dice. They can also detect invisible foes or opponents in heavy fog or other obscuring conditions allowing them to strike without any miss chance.
Woodland Stride (Ex) Plant-imbued creatures can move through any sort of undergrowth at their full movement rate without taking any penalties or suffering any damage. Magical enchantments designed to impede movement still affect them.
