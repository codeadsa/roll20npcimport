SPECIAL ABILITIES
Encage (Ex) As a swift action, an urannag can encage a creature that shares its space and is not aware of it or a helpless creature it has entrapped. The target treats the urannag’s space as difficult terrain, and cannot move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag’s CMD) as a full-round action, or it can try to smash through a cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22, hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself.
The save DC is Strength-based.
Exposed Mechanisms (Ex) Although an urannag is a construct, it can be harmed by the methods used to disable traps.
A successful DC 20 Disable Device check targeting an urannag (a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses the urannag’s DR equal to 3d6 + the character’s total ranks in Disable Device. Additionally, the urannag is staggered for 1 round (DC 16 Fort negates the staggered condition).
Living Trap (Ex) Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against an urannag’s attacks.
