SPECIAL ABILITIES
Possession (Su) Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn’t require a receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm’s body vanishes into the opponent’s body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 21). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm’s possession ability for one day.
A possessing phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed creature can attempt a Will save (DC 19) each round to force the phantasm out of its body. If successful, the phantasm is ejected from the host and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
