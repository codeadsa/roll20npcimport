SPECIAL ABILITIES
Host Buffer (Ex) A wizard’s shackle that has dominated a host uses the host’s saving throws if they are better than the wizard’s shackle’s saving throws.
Puppet Master (Su) If a wizard’s shackle attaches to a creature that can cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or become dominated (as per dominate monster). The domination lasts as long as the wizard’s shackle remains in contact with the victim. If the target would receive a new save against the effect (as described in the spell), a successful save allows it to avoid taking the action, but doesn’t end the domination. The save DC is Intelligencebased and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Tenacious Grip (Ex) A wizard’s shackle gains a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers.
