SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spines (Ex) Targets of a bristle boar’s successful gore attack must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw to avoid being speared by the dangerously sharp spines around its head and neck. Failure results in 1d4 points of piercing damage as well as 1 point of bleed damage per round for 3 rounds. Bleed damage from multiple spines doesn’t stack, but the duration is reset by subsequent attacks.
Magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check ends the bleed effect. The save DC is Strength-based.
