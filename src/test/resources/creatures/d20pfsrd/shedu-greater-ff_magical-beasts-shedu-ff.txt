SPECIAL ABILITIES
Speaker of the Law (Su) Three times per day a greater shedu can speak a word of power. Chaotic creatures in a 30-ft. radius are stunned for 1d4 rounds if they fail a DC 22 Will save. On a successful save chaotic creatures are dazed for 1 round. A creature that saves is immune to any further uses of that shedu’s ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Ethereal Jaunt (Su) As a move action, a shedu can move from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action and shift back as a move action. Otherwise, this ability is identical to the ethereal jaunt spell.
Spells Greater shedu cast spells as a 10th-level cleric but do not gain access to domains or other clerical abilities.
