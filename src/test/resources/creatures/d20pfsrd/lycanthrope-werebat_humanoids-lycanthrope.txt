SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A werebat has three forms—a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A werebat can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. If slain, it reverts to its humanoid form, but remains dead.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A werebat’s bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim’s size is not within one size category, this ability has no effect.
Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, a werebat can communicate and empathize with bats and dire bats. It can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal’s attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check.
