SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alchemy (Ex) When an alchemical embalming golem strikes a foe, the attack deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The save DC are Constitution-based.
Bombs (Ex) As a standard action, an alchemical embalming golem can throw a bomb as a ranged touch attack to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). If the attack misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands. Anyone struck by an alchemical embalming golem’s bomb takes 8d6 points of negative energy damage. In addition, all creatures adjacent to the location where the bomb hits take 1d6 points of negative energy damage.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An alchemical embalming golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the sonic descriptor. Shatter damages an alchemical embalming golem as if it were a crystalline creature.
Negative Energy Charged (Su) Alchemical embalming golems are charged with necromantic power, and their alchemy and bombs abilities always deal negative energy damage rather than random effects.
Splash (Ex) Any strike on an alchemical embalming golem with a non-reach melee weapon deals 1 point of negative energy damage to the attacker. This amount increases to 1d6 points of damage if the attack is a critical hit.
