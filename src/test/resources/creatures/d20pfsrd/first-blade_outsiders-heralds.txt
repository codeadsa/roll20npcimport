SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bladed Slam (Ex) The First Blade’s slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.
Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks, and as adamantine, chaotic, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
Ironsense (Ex) The First Blade automatically detects iron objects within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
Immunity to Magic (Su) The First Blade has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem. It can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action.
Lord of Battle (Ex) The First Blade is proficient in all weapons, and counts as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for the purposes of all prerequisites.
Rage Aura (Su) Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of rage automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return.
Swarm Form (Su) The herald can transform into a floating swarm of Tiny sharp metal fragments. In this form it has the swarm subtype, cannot make slam attacks, gains the distraction ability (DC 28), and can make a swarm attack that deals 4d6 points of slashing damage to its targets.
