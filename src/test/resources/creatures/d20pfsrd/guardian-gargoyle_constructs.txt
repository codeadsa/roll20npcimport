SPECIAL ABILITIES
Freeze (Ex) A gargoyle guardian can hold itself so still that it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle guardian that uses freeze can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.
Snatch (Ex) A gargoyle guardian can start a grapple when it hits with both claw attacks, as though it had the grab ability. If it grapples a creature of size Medium or smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic claw damage with a successful grapple check. A gargoyle guardian can fly while holding a creature that weighs 350 pounds or less. It cannot throw creatures it is carrying, but can drop them as a free action.
