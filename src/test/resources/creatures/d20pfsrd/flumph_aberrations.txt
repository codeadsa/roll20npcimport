SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of acid damage immediately and another 1d4 points of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can end the acidâ€™s effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact with a living flumph.
Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul- smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet. To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).
