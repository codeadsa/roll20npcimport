SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dreamwalker (Su) An uinuja can travel between Elysium and the Dimension of Dreams at will, as per dream travel, except that it cannot enter any other planes or take other creatures with it.
Psychic Starknife (Su) After being used in a ranged attack, an uinuja’s starknife turns into a spiritual weapon (caster level equal to the uinuja’s Hit Dice) and immediately makes a full attack against the same target. An uinuja can teleport its starknife back to its hand as a move action, which ends this effect.
