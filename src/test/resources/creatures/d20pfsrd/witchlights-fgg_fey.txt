SPECIAL ABILITIES
Glimmer (Su) Witchlights produce a luminance in their larval stage equal to a candle in brightness. In their adult and elder stage the light is up to half torchlight intensity (bright light in a 10 ft. radius). They can change the intensity or extinguish this light as a free action. The glimmer is a steady, soft glow, and may be silvery-white or just about any color, though the fey that raise them favor pastel shades. Each witchlight has its own unique color which it cannot change.
