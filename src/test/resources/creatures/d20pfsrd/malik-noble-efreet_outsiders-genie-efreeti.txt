SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Size (Sp) Twice per day, a noble efreeti can magically change a creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Heat (Ex) An noble efreeti’s body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.
