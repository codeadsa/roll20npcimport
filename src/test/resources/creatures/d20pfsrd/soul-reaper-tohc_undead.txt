SPECIAL ABILITIES
Soul Slash (Su) If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its soul torn from its body and pulled into the soul reaper’s scythe. If the save succeeds, the victim takes an extra 3d6 points of damage. A soul reaper’s scythe can hold a number of souls equal to its Charisma bonus (four souls for a typical soul reaper). This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
A creature’s soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk, and in one day crumbles to dust.
To reclaim a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek their original body (if it’s been less than one day since the body was killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.
Inseparable Weapon (Su) A soul reaper has a mystic and magical connection to its scythe. If separated from its scythe (if the soul reaper is disarmed, for example) and within 100 feet of it, it may summon it to its hands as a move action. If an opponent is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent must succeed on a DC 26 Strength check or the weapon flies from its hands to the soul reaper. The check DC is Charisma-based.
