SPECIAL ABILITIES
Gaze (Ex) Turn to stone permanently (as flesh to stone), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 17 negates. A creature petrified in this matter that is then coated (not just splashed) with fresh thessalisk blood (taken from a thessalisk no more than 1 hour dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single thessalisk contains enough blood to coat 2d3 Medium creatures in this manner. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Grab (Ex) A thessalmonster with a tail can grab an opponent up to one size smaller with a successful tail slash attack. It can then attempt a grapple check as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, the thessalmonster establishes a hold and can constrict.
Hydra Traits (Ex) Though a thessalmonster cannot be killed by severing all of its serpentine heads, doing so prevents them from attacking and can assist in slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head.
A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the thessalmonster’s HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head’s hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the thessalmonster’s body equal to the thessalmonsters’s current HD. A thessalmonster can’t attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.
