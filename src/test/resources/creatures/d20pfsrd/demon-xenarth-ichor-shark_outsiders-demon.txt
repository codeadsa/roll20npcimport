OFFENSE Before Combat Unlike their stupid bulette cousins, xenarths possess some tactical skills. They prefer to sneak up on opponents and often trail potential victims unobserved from their underground tunnels, studying them and learning their weaknesses before ambushing them in advantageous terrain.
During Combat Xenarths are afraid of nothing and attack with reckless abandon. They revel in the act of violence and eat everything they kill, if only to vomit it forth again later in a grisly and triumphant torrent.
Morale Xenarths fight to the death.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Demon Ichor (Su) A slimy red ichor coats the xenarth’s armored plates. Any weapon that touches a xenarth takes 3d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive demon essence, and the weapon’s hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 23 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature that strikes a xenarth with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, melee touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage unless the attacker makes a DC 23 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
