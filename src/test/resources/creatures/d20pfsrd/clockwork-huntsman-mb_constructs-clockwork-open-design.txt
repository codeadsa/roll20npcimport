SPECIAL ABILITIES
Diligent Sentinel (Ex) Clockwork huntsmen are designed to seek prey. They gain a +5 racial bonus to Perception checks.
Net Cannon (Ex) A mechanism within the clockwork huntsman’s chest can fire a net at any target it is aware of 1/round as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It has a range increment of 10 ft. with a maximum range of 30 ft. and a 30 ft. trailing cable (hardness 3, 10 hp) anchored within the huntsman’s chest. It functions in all other ways as a standard net. Up to four nets may be fired from the huntsman. It is a full round action to retract and re-arm a net that has missed. This mechanism explodes when a clockwork huntsman is destroyed, projecting superheated steam and shrapnel at each creature within 5 ft. of the construct (3d6 damage, Reflex DC 15 for half).
Clockwork Huntsman Construction
Though different of build, clockwork huntsmen and clockwork hounds are typically made at the same time and use very similar materials. Both are reinforced constructs demanding a heavy chassis of iron, steel, and some mithral. After construction of the bodies, a 4-day ritual involving 500 gp in special oils and chemicals activate the clockworks.
