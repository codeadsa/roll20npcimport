SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bleed (Ex) The razor-sharp claws of a crystallis cause such persistent wounds a DC 19 Heal check is required to stop the bleed damage. Healing magic works as usual.
Crystalline Claws (Ex) A crystallis’s claws are extraordinarily strong and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This is a function of the creature itself and if the claws are somehow detached or removed (say from a dead crystallis) they immediately crumble into fine powder.
Petrification Cloud (Su) A crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange smoke as a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud fills a 10-foot cube in front of the crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or turn into a crystal, gem-encrusted statue. A stone to flesh spell cannot undo this effect, but a wish or miracle can. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immunity to Earth (Ex) Crystallis’ are immune to all attacks from earth creatures (creatures with the earth subtype). They cannot be affected by an earth creature’s melee or ranged attacks or any special attack or effect that relies on touch or contact. Spell-like abilities and spells that do not require a touch attack cast by an earth creature affect a crystallis normally (but see its immunity to earth magic below).
Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) Crystallis’ are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain. Additionally, crystallises are immune to disintegration magic (a disintegrate spell for example).
