SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A Stygian leviathan can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the leviathan’s size, the leviathan takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Stygian Poisoning (Su) The Stygian leviathan’s stomach contains large quantities of water from the River Styx. Each round a swallowed opponent must succeed at a DC Swim or the swallowed creature slips underwater. Thereafter they must make a successful DC Fortitude save each round or be affected as by a feeblemind spell.
Editor’s Note
The Stygian poisoning ability is missing both its Swim and Fortitude save DC in the source material. GMs are encouraged to use a standard DC of 10+1/2HD+Con modifier or 37 for both.
