SPECIAL ABILITIES
Conflagration Gaze (Su) Burst into flames for 4d8 damage, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 12 half. The flames burst from within the target creature and immediately burn out, so there is no continuing damage or burn effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pyroliskâ€™s conflagration gaze for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Pyrotechnics (Su) Once per round, a pyrolisk can cause an ordinary fire to burst into a shower of flashes, sparks, and bursts of light (as pyrotechnics, fireworks version only). Will DC 12 to negate the blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based.
