SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deflection (Su) Due to their quasi-divine nature, evil eyes possess a deflection bonus to their AC and CMB equal to their Charisma modifier.
Gaze (Su) Evil eyes possess eight separate gaze attacks that have a range of 50 feet with a save DC of 22. The evil eye can only use one gaze attack each round and each gaze can only be used once every four rounds. The gaze attacks mimic the following spells with a caster level of 16: charm monster, confusion, deep slumber, enervation, flame strike, flesh to stone, hold monster, inflict critical wounds.
