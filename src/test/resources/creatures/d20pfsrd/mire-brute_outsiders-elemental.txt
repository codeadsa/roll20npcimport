SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Ex) Filth fever: Stakes–injury; save Fort DC 28; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Disgorge Vermin (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a mire brute can vomit forth a spray of fetid water to a range of 30 feet. The spray contains small biting insects and worms. Treat these vermin as a centipede swarm. A mire brute disgorges 1d3 centipede swarms when it uses this ability. A swarm moves to engage the closest living creature.
Drench (Ex) A mire brute can extinguish torches, campfires, exposed lanterns and other open flames of a nonmagical origin if they are of Large size or smaller. A mire brute can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (CL 21).
Impale (Ex) A mire brute can try to impale a grabbed opponent of one size smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If successful, the opponent immediately takes 4d6 points of damage and is impaled on the stakes jutting from the mire brute’s body. An impaled opponent is considered pinned and thereafter takes 3d6 points of damage each round until it breaks free. An impaled opponent must succeed on a grapple check against the mire brute’s CMD to break free. A mire brute is not considered grappled while it has an opponent impaled. A Huge mire brute can impale 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 32 Tiny or smaller opponents at one time.
