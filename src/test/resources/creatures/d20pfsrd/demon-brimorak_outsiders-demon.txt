SPECIAL ABILITIES
Boiling Blood (Su) Any creature that damages a brimorak with a non-reach slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed with its blood, taking 1d4 points of fire damage on each successful hit with such a weapon.
Burning Hooves (Su) A brimorak’s burning hooves leave scorched prints. Survival checks to track a brimorak are attempted with a +8 circumstance bonus. Against a prone foe, a brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.
Flaming Weapon (Su) As a free action, a brimorak can cause a single wielded melee weapon to deal 1d6 additional points of fire damage on a successful hit. This fire damage stacks with any fire damage that the weapon might also deal. The weapon loses this ability if it leaves the demon’s grasp.
Smoke Breath (Su) A brimorak’s breath surrounds it to a radius of 5 feet. A creature who begins its turn in this area must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1 round.
A creature gains immunity to a particular brimorak’s breath for 24 hours with a successful save. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
