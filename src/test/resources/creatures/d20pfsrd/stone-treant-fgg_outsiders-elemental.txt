SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acidic Blood (Ex) Anyone striking the stone treant with a piercing or slashing attack and inflicting damage releases a gout of acidic blood, which causes 5d4 points of acid damage to the person who struck it. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces this damage by half. The blood becomes inert one round after leaving the elemental’s body.
Radial Symmetry (Ex) Because of its shape, the stone treant can bring no more than four of its slam attacks to bear on any one target. However, it also perceives the area around it equally well, and thus it cannot be flanked.
