SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cloud of Smoke and Fire (Su) A blast shadow can, as a free action, surround itself with a cloud of smoke that burns living flesh. While active, the blast shadow gains concealment, and all living creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage per round. If the blast shadow takes any cold damage, this cloud is dispelled and cannot be renewed for 1d6 rounds.
Death Burst (Su) When a blast shadow is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a blast of flame. All creatures within 30 feet take 5d6 points of fire damage. A DC 18 Reflex save results in half damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
