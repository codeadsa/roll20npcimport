SPECIAL ABILITIES
Strangulation (Ex) A rope golem deals 1d8+3 points of damage with a successful grapple check. Because the rope golem seizes the opponent by the neck, a strangled foe cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A rope golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.
A disintegrate spell affects it normally. A rope trick or animate rope spell deals 1d6 points of damage to the rope golem per three levels of the spell caster (e.g., a 6th-level sorcerer deals 2d6 points of damage to a rope golem if it casts rope trick or animate rope). A mending spell heals the rope golem of 2d6 points of damage. Fire-based effects and spells affect it as described in its fire vulnerability above.
