Reanimation (Su) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a cadaver lord is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins the process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.
If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle repose on the cadaver when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).
