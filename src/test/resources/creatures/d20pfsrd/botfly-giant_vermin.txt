SPECIAL ABILITIES
Infestation (Ex) Upon each successful sting attack, the giant botfly implants an egg in the victim subcutaneously. Each implanted egg reacts to the warmth of the victim’s body, triggering its hatching. One day later, the egg releases a pupa that devours the host’s flesh as it develops, growing to the size of a small mouse, at which point it reaches its larval stage. If left untreated, the larva continues to develop until it kills the host or 1 week has passed, at which point it burrows out of the body and drops to the ground, where it transforms into an adult giant botfly. Individual larvae may be squeezed or cut out of the host with a DC 10 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d4 points of damage whether or not it’s successful. A remove disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host.
Giant botfly larvae: infestation; save Fort DC 10; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day for 1 week; effect 1 Con damage per larva.
