SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animate Dust (Su) Once per day, a dust ghoul can cause 1d4 ghostly humanoid-shaped creatures to materialize from an area of dust and earth within 100 feet. The dust ghoul can control and direct these creatures as long as it is “alive” and within 100 feet. The dust creatures have a speed of 10 feet and each has only one attack; a grapple. Each has a CMB equal to 1/2 dust ghoul’s HD + its Strength modifier (+12 CMB for the standard dust ghoul). A dust creature holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. The dust humanoids are immune to all attacks and spells, except water-based spells and effects. A gallon of water instantly destroys a dust humanoid. If the dust ghoul moves more than 100 feet away from a dust creature, that dust creature collapses into a pile of harmless dust. If the dust ghoul is destroyed, all dust creatures it animated collapse.
Augmented Critical (Ex) A dust ghoul’s claws are razor-sharp. It threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 19-20. On a successful critical hit with a claw, it deals triple damage.
Earth Mastery (Ex) A dust ghoul gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching the ground. If an opponent is waterborne, the dust ghoul takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
Limited Flight (Ex) A dust ghoul can fly for a number of minutes equal to its Charisma modifier (minimum 1). After that, it must rest for 10 minutes before it can fly again.
Paralyzing Shriek (Su) Once per minute, a dust ghoul can unleash a hellish shriek that paralyzes any creature within 60 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 19 Will save negate the paralysis. This is a mind-affecting, fear and sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
