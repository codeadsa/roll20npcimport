SPECIAL ABILITIES
Slime Armor (Ex) The slime excreted by a geruzou grants it a +4 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus is already included in the statistics block.
Spit Slime (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a geruzou can spit a stream of slimy goo in a 20-foot line (no range increment). This requires a successful ranged touch attack. A creature hit is slowed (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) for 6 rounds if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
