SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hail of Darts (Su) The paigoel can project a fusillade of darts from its palm in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Those caught in the hail take 10d6 damage, or half damage on a DC 23 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A paigoel never takes penalties to its attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.
Potent Charge (Ex) The paigoel can use its multiple arms to make extra attacks when charging. At the end of a successful charge, it can make up to three attacks that round instead of the normal one.
Whirling Blades (Ex) The paigoel can use its multiple arms to defend and attack. As a full-round action it can choose to grant itself a +5 deflection bonus to AC but then can only make 5 melee attacks in that round. This bonus to AC lasts until the paigoel’s next turn.
