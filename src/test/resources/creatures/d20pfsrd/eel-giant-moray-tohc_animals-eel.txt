SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Ex) Flesh Rot: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gnaw (Ex) If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing—it can make a second bite attack (+11 attack, 1d6+4) against a foe it has already grabbed.
Water Dependency (Ex) Giant moray eels can survive out of the water for 1 minute per point of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules).
