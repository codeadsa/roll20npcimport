SPECIAL ABILITIES
Command Giant (Su) A rune giant gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of charm or compulsion effects used against giants.
Runes (Ex) As a free action, whenever a rune giant uses its spark shower or spell-like abilities, it can cause the runes on its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
Spark Shower (Su) As a standard action, a rune giant can cause a shower of sparks to erupt out of one of the runes on its body. These sparks function as a breath weapon (30-ft. cone; 10d6 fire and 10d6 electricity damage; Reflex DC 29 half; usable once every 1d4 rounds). The save DC is Constitution-based.
