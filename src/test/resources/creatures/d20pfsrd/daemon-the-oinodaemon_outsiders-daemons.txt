SPECIAL ABILITIES
Disease (Ex) Daemonic Plague: Slam—injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.
Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon’s gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.
Staff of the Lower Planes: This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else’s hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon’s death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the spell of the same name (CL 25th or the wielder’s caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
Doom, fear (1 charge) Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura (2 charges) Once per day, wish (grant another’s wish) (2 charges) The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day. The staff’s powers automatically overcome any other daemon’s spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save.
