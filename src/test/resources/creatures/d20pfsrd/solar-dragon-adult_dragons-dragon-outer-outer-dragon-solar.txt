SPECIAL ABILITIES
Alien Presence (Su) A creature that fails its saving throw against a solar dragon’s alien presence is blinded for 5d6 rounds (or permanently if it has 4 Hit Dice or fewer).
Channel Life (Su) A solar dragon can channel positive energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma modifier, using its age category + 2 as its cleric level. This energy can be used only to heal living creatures.
Primal Fire (Su) A very young or older solar dragon’s breath weapon can affect creatures normally immune or resistant to fire damage. A creature immune to fire damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no damage with a successful saving throw). A resistant creature’s fire resistance is treated as 10 less than normal.
