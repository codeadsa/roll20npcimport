SPECIAL ABILITIES
Contagious Whisper (Su) As a standard action, a nogitsune can influence a target she speaks to as per the spell suggestion. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestion’s normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass the enchantment on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsune’s suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature under the nogitsune’s compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune’s compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of hours equal to its Hit Dice. Creatures that successfully save versus the nogitsune’s compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot be affected by that particular nogitsune’s compelling whisper for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Fleet Distraction (Su) A nogitsune can make a Bluff check or use its obscuring mist spell-like ability as a swift action in any round in which it moves up to half its base land speed.
Poison Use (Ex) Nogitsune are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Their aptitude is such that they often paint their weapons and nails with blue whinnis.
Blue Whinnis: injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; initial effect 1 Con damage; secondary effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours; cure 1 save.
