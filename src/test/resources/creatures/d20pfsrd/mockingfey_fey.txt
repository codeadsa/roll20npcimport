SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mock (Su) As a standard action, a mockingfey can magically take on the appearance of any creature it can see. This functions like disguise self, but with no restrictions on duration, creature type, or size. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it’s mimicking is larger than it, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a given form indefinitely, but cannot change to any form other than its own without visual reference–once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The save DC is Charisma-based.
