Scales (Ex) A tempest behemoth can hurl up to six scales from its wings (range increment 100 feet) as a standard action.
Thunderbolt (Su) As a swift action once every 1d4 rounds, a behemoth can shoot a bolt oflightning that deals 15d6 points of electricity damage and 15d6 points of sonic damage, and that causes permanent deafness in a 200-foot line (DC 34 Reflex save halves damage and negates deafness). The save DC is Constitution-based.
