SPECIAL ABILITIES
Gifted Craftsmen (Ex) Due to their skill at crafting items of all kinds, kuah-lij gain Master Craftsman as a bonus feat even if they do not have the normal prerequisites. In addition, kuah-lij only pay 75% of the total gp cost when creating magic items if they have access to a kuah-lij production facility.
Magic Item Use (Ex) Kuah-lij can use magic items as if they have 1 level of wizard. This innate ability does not increase with level unless the kuah-lij gains levels in the wizard class.
