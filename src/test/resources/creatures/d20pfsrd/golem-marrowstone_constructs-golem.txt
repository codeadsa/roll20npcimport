SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a marrowstone golem rises from death as a free-willed ghoul in 24 hours. A creature with four or more class levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast has a 25% chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life.
Immunity to Magic (Su) A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the golem, as noted below.
A transmute rock to mud spell slows a marrowstone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of damage to a marrowstone golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points. A marrowstone golem that fails its save against a magical attack that deals positive energy damage (including the channel energy ability when used to harm undead, but not when used to heal living creatures) does not take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create spawn ability, its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its slam attack for 1d4 rounds. Necrotic Field (Su) Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and supernatural abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance. Positive energy effects cause only half damage to a creature within the marrowstone golem’s aura. Their aura particularly strengthens ghouls and ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.
