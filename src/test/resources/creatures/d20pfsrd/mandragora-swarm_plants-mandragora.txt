SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood Drain (Ex) Whenever a mandragora swarm damages a foe with its swarm damage, it also drains blood, dealing 1d6 points of Strength damage. A mandragora that drains blood from a target with 0 Strength instead deals 2d4 points of Constitution damage.
Hive Mind (Ex) The mandragora swarm has one central mind, but retains its immunity to mind-affecting effects due to its plant traits.
Poison (Ex) Swarmâ€”injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Shriek (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora swarm can give voice to an unsettling shriek that sounds not unlike the cry of a thousand tiny babies. Any creature within 30 feet of a shrieking mandragora swarm must make a DC 25 Will save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Vulnerable to Darkness (Ex) A mandragora swarm in an area of darkness loses its fast healing and becomes slowed, as per the spell.
