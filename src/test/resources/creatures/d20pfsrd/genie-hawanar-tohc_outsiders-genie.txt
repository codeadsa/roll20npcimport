SPECIAL ABILITIES
Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a hawanar.
Heat (Ex) A hawanar’s fists are swathed in white-hot fire that deals 1d8 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling. The hawanar’s metallic weapons conduct this heat. The hawanar can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Holocone (Su) A hawanar can transform into a vortex of embers and white-hot fire once every 10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The save DC includes a +3 racial adjustment.
