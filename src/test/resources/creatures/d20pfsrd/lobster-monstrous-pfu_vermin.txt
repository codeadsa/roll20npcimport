SPECIAL ABILITIES
Vulnerable to Sunder A sunder combat maneuver can be used to break a monstrous lobster’s combat claw (15 hit points, hardness 5). If its claw is broken, the monstrous lobster immediately drops any creature it is grappling. Until its claw heals in 1d4 weeks, the monstrous lobster cannot use its combat claw melee attack, or the accompanying grab and constrict abilities. During this time, its other claw is still treated as a secondary attack.
