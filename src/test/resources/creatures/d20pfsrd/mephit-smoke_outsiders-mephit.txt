SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ember Storm (Sp) Once per day a smoke mephit can create a downpour of white-hot embers that affects a 20- foot radius. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half, caster level 6th). This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Fast Healing (Ex) A smoke mephit heals only if it is exposed to smoke or soot (whether magically created or mundane in nature).
Sooty Breath (Su) Living creatures that fail their saves against the smoke mephit’s breath weapon are tormented by burning eyes. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
