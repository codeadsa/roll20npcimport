SPECIAL ABILITIES
Malleable (Ex) A giant slug can squeeze its body through openings a creature its size normally could not. It can squeeze through tight spaces as if it were a Medium-sized creature.
Rubbery Hide (Ex) A giant slug’s rubbery hide grants it immunity to critical hits and precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks.
Salt Vulnerability (Ex) A giant slug is highly susceptible to salt, and takes 1d6 points of damage per pound of salt it contacts.
Spit Acid (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a giant slug can spit a line of acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range increment). A successful ranged touch attack is required to hit. If struck, a target takes 4d8 points of acid damage.
