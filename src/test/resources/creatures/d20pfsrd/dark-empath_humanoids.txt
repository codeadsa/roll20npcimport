SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Su) When a dark empath dies, it unleashes a burst of chaotic emotion. Each creature within a 10-foot burst must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become confused, as per the spell lesser confusion. All other dark empaths within 10 feet automatically fail this save as the uncontrolled emotion overwhelms them.
Infectious Emotion (Sp) A dark empath devours emotion. When the emotion it consumes becomes overwhelming, the dark empath flings it out with abandon, inflicting wild emotional states on enemies and kin alike. Whenever a dark empath is under an emotion or fear effect, it can spend a swift action on its turn to affect a living creature within 30 feet as if by either the rage or lesser confusion spell for 1 round, and the duration of all emotion and fear effects on the dark empath decreases by 1 time increment (1 round if the spell is measured in rounds per level, etc.). It can use this ability even if an emotion or fear effect would normally prevent it from acting.
