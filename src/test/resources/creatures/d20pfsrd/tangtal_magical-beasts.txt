SPECIAL ABILITIES
Duplicate (Su) As a standard action, a tangtal can create an effect similar to a mirror image spell (caster level 12th). This allows the tangtal to create up to eight images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the mirror image spell.
