TACTICS
Before Combat The sunlord casts aid and see invisibility before a battle. If facing an evil outsider, he casts dispel evil. If he has allies, he casts aid on all of them and see invisibility on leaders, then casts holy aura on himself to further protect them. He only uses invisibility if he thinks his foe is too great to deal with in open combat, otherwise he prefers to charge into battle to inspire allies and witnesses.
During Combat He always tries to engage the most powerful opponent on the battlefield, especially if that opponent could easily defeat or kill his allies. If faced with a dangerous foe who cannot fly, he takes to the air and uses his bow and ranged abilities, closing to melee if others are threatened or to deliver a killing blow. If he has a free round or has to move to another foe, he renews his dispel evil. If he sees good allies are swarmed by weaker evil creatures, he casts holy smite. He uses blade barrier to shield vulnerable allies or divert enemies. The angel saves his heal spell for friendly leaders, though he is not averse to healing himself if he believes his own survival will do more good in the course of a battle.
Morale Immortal and renewed every day, he never surrenders and fights to the death if doing so can save others. If the battle has turned against his allies, he tries to rescue as many as he can with plane shift, transporting them to a safe place in his god’s realm, often making several such trips if there is time.
