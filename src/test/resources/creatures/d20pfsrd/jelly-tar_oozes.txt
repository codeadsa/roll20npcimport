SPECIAL ABILITIES
Flammable (Ex) If a tar jelly is exposed to an attack that would normally inflict fire damage if the ooze was not immune, the tar jelly burns for 1d6 rounds afterwards, adding 1d6 fire damage to its slam attacks and constriction damage. Those with tar jelly tendrils attached to them also take 1d6 fire damage each round that they are attached.
Sticky (Ex) Any opponent within 5 feet of the tar jelly who successfully hits it with a melee attack automatically receives a ropey tendril of tar affixed to him. Those affected by the tar tendrils cannot move more than 5 feet away from the tar jelly and take a –2 penalty to AC as long as they are stuck. The tar jelly tendril can be removed by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tendril (AC 11, damage does not deplete the tar jelly’s actual hit points, nor incur a new tendril). The tar jelly cannot move more than 5 feet away from the target, but can release its tendril as a free action. There is no limit to the number of tendrils that a tar jelly can produce, but only one tendril can affect each individual target at a time. A tar jelly has a +4 bonus to attacks opponents that have its tendrils affixed to them.
