SPECIAL ABILITIES
Camouflage (Ex) Because it remains buried until it attacks, it takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to detect the presence of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.
Tentacles (Ex) The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature’s tentacles are treated as separate weapons. A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties. Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature’s total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.
