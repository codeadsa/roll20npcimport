SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fling (Ex) If a deadly mantis begins its turn with a Large or smaller creature grabbed in its claws, it can, as a standard action, fling that creature up to 30 feet away. Creatures thrown in this way take 3d6 points of damage as if they had fallen from the same distance.
Rending Mandibles (Ex) If a deadly mantis hits with both claws and successfully grabs a foe, it can make an immediate bite attack against that foe as a secondary attack. This bite attack has a +12 attack bonus and deals 4d6+6 points of damage. In addition to dealing damage, the mantis can tear away the victim’s armor as a free action by making a combat maneuver check. If the mantis is successful, the target’s armor is ripped from its body. If the target fails a DC 31 Reflex save, the armor subjected to this attack loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The save DC is Strength-based.
