SPECIAL ABILITIES
Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the cetaceal. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals cetaceal’s HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in the above stat block.
Shockwave (Su) Once per day, a cetaceal can release a 100-foot radius burst of energy. All creatures in the area take 17d6 damage; half of this damage is cold, and half is electricity (DC 25 Reflex save halves). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Stun (Ex) Any creature moved by a cetaceal’s push attack must make a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The DC is Constitution-based.
