SPECIAL ABILITIES
Broken Ground (Su) The ground in a 30-foot radius around a guecubu ripples and shudders unnaturally. This transforms the area surrounding a guecubu into difficult terrain. A guecubu can move through this area with no penalty. Consecrated ground cannot be affected by this ability, nor can any area warded by a magic circle against chaos or a magic circle against evil.
Misfortune (Su) A creature struck by a guecubu must make a DC 20 Will save or become permanently cursed with misfortune. The victim of this curse takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and any critical threat against the victim automatically confirms. If a guecubu hits a creature already suffering from this curse, the victim must make a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
