SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) The Herald of Dreams’ breath weapon creates sticky webbing (as the web universal monster ability). It can use this ability in the air to entangle flying creatures without requiring the use of anchor points to hold the web in place.
Dream Dust (Su) As a full-round action, The Herald of Dreams can flutter its wings to create a 30-foot burst of dust centered on itself. This dust affects creatures as deep slumber, but with no Hit Die limit (Will DC 25 negates).
This ability is usable once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison Flesh (Ex) Any creature that bites the Herald of Dreams is exposed to black lotus extract poison. Eating it’s flesh gives the attacker a –4 penalty on the poison’s saving throw.
