SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spit Acid (Ex) An ankhrav can spit a 60-foot line of digestive fluid that deals 7d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 21 half). Once an ankhrav uses this ability, the acid damage dealt by the ankhrav’s bite attack is reduced by 1d6 for 1 hour. If the ankhrav’s bite attack would not deal any acid damage, it cannot spit acid. The save DC is Constitution-based.
