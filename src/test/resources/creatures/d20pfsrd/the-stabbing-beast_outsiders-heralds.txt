SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) In its scorpion form, replace or add the following statistics:
Size Huge; Init +14; AC 31, touch 21, flat-footed 20 (+10 Dex, +1 dodge, +10 natural); Ref +16; Melee claws +28 (2d6+13 plus bleed and grab), sting +26 (2d6+11 plus bleed and poison); Space 15 ft.; Reach 15 ft.; Special Attacks constrict (2d6+12); Str 32, Dex 31; CMB +30 (+34 grapple); CMD 53 (65 vs. trip); Skills Climb +20, Stealth +24.
Murderer’s Reward (Su) If the Stabbing Beast’s attack reduces a target to fewer than 0 hit points, the herald immediately gains 2d6 temporary hit points (or 3d8, if the attack kills the target), but no more than the target’s maximum hit points.
The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
Poison (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Poison Stream (Ex) As a ranged attack (or in place of a melee sting attack), the Stabbing Beast can fire a stream of poison up to 180 feet at an opponent’s eyes. The target must succeed at a save against the Stabbing Beast’s poison or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds.
Sudden Strike (Ex) During a surprise round, the herald may act as if it had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.
