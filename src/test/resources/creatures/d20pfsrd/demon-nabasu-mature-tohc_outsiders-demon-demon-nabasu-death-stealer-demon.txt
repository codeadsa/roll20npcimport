SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Gaze (Su) A mature nabasu can use its death gaze for a full round ten times per day. Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed.
Paralysis Aura (Su) As a free action, once per day, a mature nabasu can release a paralysis arua in a 10-ft. radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Fort save or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 rounds. Demons are immune to this aura. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Plane Shift (Su) Three times per day a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature nabasu).
