SPECIAL ABILITIES
Barbed Defense (Su) A creature that strikes a hamatula with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the devil’s barbs. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger a user in this way.
Fear (Su) A barbed devil’s fear attack affects any creature it damages with its claws. A DC 20 Will save resists this effect, otherwise the victim becomes frightened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Grab (Ex) A barbed devil can use its grab attack against a foe up to Medium size
Impale (Ex) A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.
