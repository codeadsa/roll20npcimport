TACTICS
Before Combat An intelligent, vicious hunter, heralds of the demon queen track their prey relentlessly. They begin combat by baying in an attempt to panic and divide its targets.
During Combat Heralds of the demon queen try to catch a large group in its madding vision, and then rely on its poison gout to disable remaining victims, so it may dispatch them in a savage, horrific manner.
Morale As an apex abyssal predator, a herald of the demon queen has little to fear, and will fight to the death.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bay (Su) When heralds of the demon queen howl or bark, each creature within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Evil outsiders are immune to this ability.
Whether or not it succeeds at its save, a creature in the area is immune to the bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Breath Weapon (Su) The heralds of the demon queen’s breath weapon is a jet of smoke. Any nonchaotic creature that takes damage from this breath weapon must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Soul Scream (Su) Anytime a herald of the demon queen takes piercing or slashing damage, its wounds create a terrifying cacophony equivalent to its bay ability. Creatures within 10 feet of it take a –4 penalty on their saves against this effect.
Poison (Ex) Contact or bite—injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
