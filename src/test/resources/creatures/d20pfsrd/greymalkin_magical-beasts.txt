SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dimensional Lunge (Su) Because it is out of phase with the Material Plane, a greymalkin can briefly shift its position relative to the world around it. Any time the greymalkin makes an attack with its claws, it may choose to shift itself a total of 10 feet in any direction for a split second, before returning to its previous location. (It cannot choose not to return to its prior location.) This essentially grants it 15-foot reach with its claws.
