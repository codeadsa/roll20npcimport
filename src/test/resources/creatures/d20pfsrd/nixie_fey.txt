SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid ability of the same name. The nixie’s total includes a +8 racial bonus on wild empathy checks.
Lure (Su) This ability functions just like a harpy’s captivating song. A DC 15 Will save negates this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shapeshift (Su) A nixie can change shape to become any Small or Medium aquatic creature as if using beast shape I (CL 5th). A nixie can maintain this form indefinitely and can return to its normal shape as a free action.
