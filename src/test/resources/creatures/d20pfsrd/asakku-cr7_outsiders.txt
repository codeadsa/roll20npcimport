SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deflecting winds (Su) An asakku is constantly surrounded by a maelstrom of buffeting winds. Anyone making a ranged attack against an asakku takes a –8 penalty to his or her attack rolls. An asakku can dismiss or resume its aura as a free action.
Maddening winds (Su) Creatures within a 30-foot radius of an asakku are assaulted by a vortex of maddening wind. Any creature listening to the strains of this wind must make a DC 19 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. A new save must be made every round that a creature remains within the radius, but a successful save renders a creature immune to the wind’s effects for 24 hours. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom slips into a comatose-like nightmare from which it cannot awaken. An asakku can dismiss or resume its aura as a fee action. Maddening winds is a sonic mind-affecting effect to which deaf creatures and other asakku are immune. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Poisonous Lash (Su) The asp-like tail of an asakku is coated with powerful supernatural venom that it can deliver with a strike:
Asakku Lash Poison (Su) Lash—injury; save Fort DC 18, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d2 Int, cure 2 consecutive saves;
Creatures affected by this poison appear feverish and can’t focus their thoughts. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Summon Elemental (Sp) Once per day, a group of three or more asakku can spend a full-round action to summon a NE large air elemental with maximum hit points and a +2 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls. This ability is equivalent to a 9th-level spell and the asakku must be within 30 feet of each other to use it
