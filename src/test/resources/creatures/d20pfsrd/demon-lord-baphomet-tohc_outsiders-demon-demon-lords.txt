TACTICS
Baphomet attacks using his bite, butting with his head, and slashing with his Huge halberd, Musileim. He is relentless in combat and rarely shows mercy to his opponents. Should he become bored with combat, he summons a slew of demons or minotaurs to dispatch of his opponents as he stands and watches the slaughter.
Baphomet’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. His natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
