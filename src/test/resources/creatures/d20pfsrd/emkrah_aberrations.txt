SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Spittle (Ex) An emkrah can spit a glob of its highly corrosive goo up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Creatures struck by this acid spittle take 1d8 points of acid damage.
Acidic (Ex) An emkrah’s body is little more than a shell of gelatinous digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly. Any fleshy, living creature that attacks an emkrah with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike, or attempts to grapple a emkrah, takes 1d8 points of acid damage.
Amorphous (Ex) An emkrah is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.
Doom Gaze (Su) Deals 1d6 points of damage, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates. If an emkrah actively uses its gaze upon a creature, it deals 1d8 points of damage. Evil creatures gain a +2 bonus on their saves versus an emkrah’s doom gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Swallow Whole (Ex) An emkrah doesn’t actually “swallow” the opponent–it engulfs it within its gelatinous form–but the effect is essentially the same. An emkrah can continue to bite a creature that has been swallowed whole, and it retains its full natural armor bonus against the swallowed creature.
