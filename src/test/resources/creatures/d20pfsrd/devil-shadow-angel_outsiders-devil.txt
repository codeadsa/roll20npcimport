TACTICS
Combat A shadow angel descends from above, throwing back its cowl as a free action to reveal its awfulness, and then attacks an opponent with its scythe. It keeps its cowl down until every opponent has saved, using flyby attacks to whittle away at its enemies.
Morale Despite these creature’s vast intellects, they blame mortals for their condition, ignoring their own culpability. Thus, they fight to the death in any conflict involving mortals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Horrific Appearance (Su) Any living creature within 60 feet that views the shadow angel must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength, 1d4 points of Dexterity, and 1d4 Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Howl (Su) Once per day, the shadow angel can produce a shriek of heart rending sorrow and soul chilling fear. All creatures within 100 feet of the shadow angel must succeed a DC 26 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with dread and sadness for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Unbound (Ex) Provided they can find the means, shadow angels can leave Hell and enter any non-Good plane without restriction. Normally, devils must be summoned or granted passage by a higher power in order for them to leave the Lower Planes.
