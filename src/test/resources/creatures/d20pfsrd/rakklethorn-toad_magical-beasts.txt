TACTICS
A rakklethorn toad attacks by arching its back and firing a volley of thorns at an opponent. It rarely ever closes to melee, preferring to attack at range. If confronted in close quarters, a rakklethorn toad usually flees or if cornered, attacks with its bite.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Thornsâ€”injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d6 Dexterity; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic, applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.
Thorns (Ex) From its back, the rakklethorn toad can fire a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal 1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.
