Stagnation Aura (Su) A blightspawn’s stagnation aura causes lethargy and torpor in those who approach it, sapping their energy and speed. When a creature comes within 20 feet of a blightspawn, it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected as per the slow spell for as long as the creature remains within the blightspawn’s aura and for an additional 1d3 rounds after leaving it. Once a creature successfully saves against the aura, it is immune to that particular blightspawn’s aura for 24 hours; otherwise, reentering the aura forces a creature to save again. In addition, this aura fouls liquids of all types within the area. A creature that drinks anything in a blightspawn’s aura (including potions and alchemical elixirs) must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
