TACTICS
During Combat The Cat Lord almost always assumes feline form (if he’s not already in that form) and attacks with two claws and a bite. The Cat Lord often enters combat with both haste and blur in effect. If combat goes against him, he usually summons a group of felines to his aid or to cover his escape.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) The Cat Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl, pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his movement modes (and speeds) in human form.
Feline Passivism (Ex) Felines (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Cat Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Cat Lord attacks a feline, its protection against that creature ends.
Howl (Su) When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat Lord’s howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Immortality (Su) The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Cat Lord’s soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to inhabit).
Keen Senses (Ex) The Cat Lord sees five times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and normal light.
Spit (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a ranged attack, the Cat Lord can spit a line of caustic saliva at a single target to a range of 30 feet. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be blinded. Remove blindness or dispel magic (vs. CL 19th) removes the blindness effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
