TACTICS
An amaimon ruthlessly attacks any creatures it encounters. It begins combat with its breath weapon seeking to engulf as many of its opponents within the area as possible. It always enters combat against good-aligned foes with its protection from good in effect raking with its claws and gnashing with its bite. If the battle turns against the amaimon it summons a horde of lemures or another amaimon to its aid.
