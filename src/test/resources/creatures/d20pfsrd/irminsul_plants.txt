SQ planar portal
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Planar Portal (Su) Within the split of an irminsul’s trunk swirls a large planar portal, a permanent gate that links one plane to another. An irminsul controls whether or not specific creatures can pass through its portal, which grants entrance to a specific location on the linked plane. Those attempting to breach a barred portal must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be ejected and teleported to a random location on the current plane. If the trespasser successfully saves, it takes 6d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 minute. The DC for this save is Wisdom-based. Mythic characters can expend uses of Mythic Power to forcefully pass through the gate, lowering the DC of the saving throw by 5 for each use of Mythic Power expended in this fashion.
