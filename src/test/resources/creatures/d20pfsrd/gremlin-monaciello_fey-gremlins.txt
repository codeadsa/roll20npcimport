SPECIAL ABILITIES
Magic Bag (Su) A monaciello always carries its pouch with it. This pouch contains an extradimensional space and operates like a bag of holding (type I). If this pouch is separated from the monaciello, all of its former contents are lost, and it becomes a normal bag that contains a number of coins equal to double the treasure value of a creature of the gremlin’s CR. A monaciello that loses its pouch must create a new one, a process that takes 1d4 days. Until the new pouch is finished, it remains a non-magical bag, only becoming a fully functional extradimensional space once completed.
Stymie Channeling (Su) A monaciello gremlin is surrounded by an aura of blasphemy. Any creatures channeling energy within 20 feet of a monaciello must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but the action is wasted.
