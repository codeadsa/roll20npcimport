TACTICS
Mandrills are generally passive creatures and rarely engage in battle, preferring to outmaneuver would-be-attackers by taking to the trees and outrunning their opponents. If the young are threatened, they do not hesitate to attack. Mandrills defending their group always fight to the death. Likewise, a foraging pack that is molested defends its “treasure” if food is scarce; otherwise, it usually drops its food (or sticks it in its cheek pouches) and scurries into the trees.
