SPECIAL ABILITIES
Strangulation (Ex) As a standard action a mummy golem can attempt to wrap bandages from its body around a grappled foe’s throat. The mummy golem makes a grapple check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips several bandages around the foe’s throat and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling it.
