SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Stroke (Su) If the Slaad Lord of Entropy scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with his scythe and confirms the critical hit, that opponent must succeed on a DC 35 Fortitude save or die. Creatures slain can be raised normally, but there is only a 50% chance that such magic works. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, a creature struck takes 8d6 points of damage (which may be enough to kill it anyway). This ability only functions in the hands of the Slaad Lord of Entropy.
