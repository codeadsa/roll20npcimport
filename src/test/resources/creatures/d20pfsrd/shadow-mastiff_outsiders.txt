SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bay (Su) When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures within a 300-foot spread except evil outsiders must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiffâ€™s bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss chance). Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
