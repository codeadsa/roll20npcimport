SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dream Eater’s Caress (Su) Dream eaters drain energy from dreaming mortals. When a victim is grappled, a dream eater can bestow 1 negative level. This caress also has the effect of suggestion (DC 19; Cha-based), directing the victim to commit another sin offered by the dream eater. A DC 19 Fortitude save (Cha-based) is required to remove a negative level bestowed by this effect.
Lotus Scent (Ex) The dream eater secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature finds intoxicating. All living creatures within 30 ft. must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save (Con-based) or be shaken for 2d6 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same creature’s lotus scent for 24 hours. Delay poison or neutralize poison removes the effect from the shaken creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Creatures with the lotus scent ability are immune to its effects.
Waking Dreams (Su) As a standard action 1/day, the dream eater can make those around it enter waking dreams. All creatures within 20 ft. of the dream eater begin dreaming unless they make a DC 19 Will save (Cha-based). Dreaming creatures are confused for 6 rounds.
