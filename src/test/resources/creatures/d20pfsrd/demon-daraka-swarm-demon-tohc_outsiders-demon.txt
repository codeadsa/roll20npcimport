TACTICS
During Combat Darakas aggressively assault any creature that stands in their way. They usually open combat by slinging scorpions at their opponents and using chaos hammer against lawful-aligned opponents. Against an enemy wizard, a daraka uses feeblemind as soon as it can. The remainder of the combat sees the daraka slash with its claws and bite with its terrible fangs. If it can, a daraka likes to grapple a foe and let the scorpions on its body bite the grabbed opponent.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Scorpions—injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Scorpions (Ex) A daraka’s body is swarming with thousands of tiny scorpions. Creatures attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion’s poison (see Poison, above).
Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka’s scorpions just as if it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above).
A daraka has an unlimited supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.
