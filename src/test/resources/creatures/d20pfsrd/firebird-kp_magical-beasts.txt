SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blinding Ray (Su) Erupting from its radiant tail feathers, a firebird can fire a burning ray of light up to 50 ft. 1/round as a standard action. This attack deals 5d6 fire damage, and the target struck must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save (Cha-based) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
Light of the World (Su) A firebird’s feathers glow with a warm light. The creature can cause itself to shed light as dim as a candle up to as bright as a hooded lantern. A firebird always sheds light, and any feathers plucked from the creature continue to shed light as an everburning torch.
Warming Presence (Su) A firebird and any creatures within a 5-ft. radius don’t feel the sting of cold and are affected as if by an endure elements spell. Invited into a home or building, a firebird can expand this warming presence to its inhabitants no matter how close they are to the creature.
