TACTICS
A fetch is a ruthless opponent, slashing its foes with its wicked claws. Fetches always fight to the death, but are smart enough to flee when presented with fire, if they cannot attack the opponent wielding the fire. If a fetch flees from an encounter because of fire, it follows the one who presented the fire (lurking in the shadows, hiding in cover) and eventually exacts its revenge.
