SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blindness Aura (Su) An ancient mithral dragon can shift its gleaming scales to blind and disorient opponents. Any creature within 5 ft. of the dragon must make a DC 29 Fortitude save or be blinded and confused for 1 round. This aura extends out to 10 ft. A mithral dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.
Breath Weapon (Su) An ancient mithral dragon can fire a line of mithral shards that deal piercing and slashing damage. These shards count as adamantine, cold iron, good, and silver for purposes of overcoming DR. An ancient mithral dragon’s shards deal 12 bleed damage in addition to the normal damage. This bleed damage is not halved with a successful saving throw.
These shards dissolve into wisps of smoke 1 round after the breath weapon‘s use.
Fortification (Su) An ancient mithral dragon has a 50% chance of negating critical hits or sneak attacks.
Perfect Flight (Ex) An ancient mithral dragon’s maneuverability is one step better than normal.
Razor Claws (Ex) An ancient mithral dragon’s claws are exceptionally sharp. Whenever a mithral dragon makes a successful attack with its claws, it deals bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage a creature takes depends on age category.
Spell-Like Abilities (Su) An ancient mithral dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, all usable at will:
mage armor; bull’s strength; dispel magic; dimension door; break enchantment.
Editor’s Note
Based on the Razor Claws description, this dragon should have 10 bleed for its claw attacks.
