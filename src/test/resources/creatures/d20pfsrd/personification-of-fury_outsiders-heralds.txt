SPECIAL ABILITIES
Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the herald.
Drench (Ex) The herald’s touch puts out Huge or smaller non-magical flames. The herald can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 19th).
Energy Ray (Ex) The herald can shoot rays of cold or electricity up to 100 feet. These can threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.
Vortex (Su) The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.
Water Mastery (Ex) The herald gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (Unlike a water elemental, the herald does not have a penalty if it or its opponent is touching the ground.)
