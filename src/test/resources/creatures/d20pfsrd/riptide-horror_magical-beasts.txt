TACTICS
Riptide horrors prefer to attack from ambush; sitting unmoving until potential prey moves within range. Often, they use their spider climb ability to cling to sea cave walls where their unsuspecting prey walks underneath them. Once prey wanders too close, the riptide horror lashes out with its tentacles and attempts to grab its meal. Grabbed foes are subjected to its paralytic poison and are bitten by its razor-sharp teeth.
