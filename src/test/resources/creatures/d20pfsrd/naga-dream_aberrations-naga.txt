SQ dream passage
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dream Passage (Su) A dream naga can physically enter dreamscapes in the Dimension of Dreams and dwell within those dreams without disorientation or other debilitating effects. The naga can also attempt impossible feats while in a dreamscape in its physical body, and it gains the bonuses from the Lucid Dreamer feat when it does.
Dreamsight (Ex) Just by looking at a dreaming creature or when in a dreamscape in the Dimension of Dreams, a dream naga gains a general sense of the nature of the dream. While the dream naga’s vision is not detailed, it gets a general impression of the dream’s themes and the dreamer’s current emotional state.
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Will DC 21; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect daze 1 round; cure 1 save.
Spells A dream naga casts spells as a 7th-level psychic.
