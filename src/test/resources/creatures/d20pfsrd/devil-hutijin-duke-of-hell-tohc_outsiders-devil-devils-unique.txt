TACTICS
Hutijin prefers to summon devils to deal with interlopers or adversaries, rather than waste time fighting them in melee. However, if pressed into combat, he fights with his trident, all the while peppering his foes with fireballs.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fear (Su) Hutijin can cause fear by speaking (this is a free action). Creatures within 30 feet that hear his voice must succeed on a DC 30 Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell (CL 20th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by Hutijin’s fear ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
