SPECIAL ABILITIES
Anxiety Spores (Ex) Any creature struck by the fear eater’s claws must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or be infected with anxiety spores, which cause nervousness and muscle tremors.
Anxiety Spores: Disease—injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 round; frequency 1/minute; effect cumulative –1 penalty on saving throws against emotion-manipulating effects (maximum –5); cure 2 consecutive saves.
Dread Burst (Su) As a standard action, a fear eater can cause mushrooms to erupt from any creature within 30 feet already infected with its anxiety spores.
The targeted creature takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage (Fortitude DC 17 negates) as the growing spores siphon away her emotions. If the affected creature is currently shaken, frightened, or panicked, any creature within 10 feet gains the same condition for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 17 negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Fungal Snare (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a fear eater can spew a fungal mass up to 30 feet, which explodes and coats all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst with sticky filaments. Creatures other than fear eaters are entangled (Reflex DC 17 negates). An entangled creature can attempt to break free with a successful DC 14 Strength or Escape Artist check as a move action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
