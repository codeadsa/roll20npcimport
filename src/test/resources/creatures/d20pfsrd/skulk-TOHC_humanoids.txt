SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chameleon Blend (Ex) Skulks have the ability to match their skin coloration to the surrounding environment, not unlike a chameleon. This, combined with their natural sneakiness, grants them a +15 racial bonus on Stealth checks when hiding, but only while the majority of their skin is visible to the naked eye. Thus they cannot use this ability while wearing armor or any clothing more than a loincloth. Skulks favor wearing cloaks when lurking on the fringes of civilized society which they can quickly remove so as to make full use of their chameleon blend ability.
Cowardice (Ex) Skulks suffer a -4 penalty to their effective Wisdom against Intimidate skill checks and a -4 penalty vs. fear-based spells and effects due to their innate cowardice.
Untrackable (Ex) Skulks can pass through forest and subterranean settings almost without a trace (double the DC for any tracking attempt).
Skulk Characters Skulks favor taking levels of rogue, almost to the exclusion of any other class. The rogue’s unparalleled competence at stealth, ambush, and escape is a role they are perfectly suited for.

Racial Skills: A skulk’s humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier). Its racial class skills are Perception and Stealth. Skulks gain a +15 racial bonus on Stealth checks when hiding due to their chameleon blend ability (see above). They suffer a -4 penalty to their effective Wisdom against Intimidate skill checks due to their innate cowardice. Saves: Skulks have a -4 penalty on all saves against fear spells and effects.
