TACTICS
Reigons attack from ambush, using their chameleon psi-like ability to hide and wait for their targets to wander close by. Once in range, a reigon leaps to the attack, slashing and biting with its claws (though occasionally, a reigon employs a club). If an opponent isn’t killed immediately it is assaulted in the following rounds by a barrage of psi-like abilities, most notably a reigon’s mind thrust or concussion blast.
Slain prey is dragged or carried back to the reigon’s lair and either stored for later consumption or distributed among the other reigon’s in the lair.
