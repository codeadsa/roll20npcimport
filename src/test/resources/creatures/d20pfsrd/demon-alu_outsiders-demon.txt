Vampiric Touch (Su) An alu-demon gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt each time she successfully hits with a claw attack. She cannot gain more than her target’s current hit points + the target’s Con score (which is enough to kill the target). The temporary hit points disappear in one hour.
