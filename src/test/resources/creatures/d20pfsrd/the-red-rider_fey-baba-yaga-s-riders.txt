SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bright Blast (Su) Three times per day, the Red Rider can erupt in flames, damaging all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Those caught in the blast must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of fire damage and be dazed for 1 round and dazzled for an additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Rider’s Robes (Su) The Red Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as half-plate armor.
Rider’s Weapon (Su) Whenever the Red Rider successfully confirms a critical hit with his +2 flaming scimitar, the target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
