SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath of Unlife (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, the demonic knight can exhale a blast of negative energy in a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by a demonic knight dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a demonic knight’s breath of unlife becomes a shadow demon in 2d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the demonic knight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
