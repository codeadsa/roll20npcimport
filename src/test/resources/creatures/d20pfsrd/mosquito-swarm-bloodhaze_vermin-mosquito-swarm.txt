SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cling (Ex) If a creature leaves a bloodhaze mosquito swarm’s square, the swarm takes 1d6 points of damage as dozens of insects tenaciously cling to the victim. A creature with bloodhaze mosquitoes clinging to it takes 1 point of Constitution damage at the end of its turn for the next 1d4 rounds. As a full-round action, the creature can remove the mosquitoes with a DC 18 Reflex save or by immersing itself in water. High winds or any amount of damage from an area-affecting effect destroys all clinging mosquitoes. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Once a group of clinging mosquitoes has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, the mosquitoes detach and disperse to digest their meal.
Disease (Ex) Bloodhaze mosquitoes are bearers of a terrifying and deadly disease common to the jungle, known to most locals as sleeping sickness.
Swarm (sleeping sickness)—injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d2 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Wisdom damage and target is fatigued, cure 2 consecutive saves or arsenic.
