SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bellows (Ex) A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its bellows as a standard action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire.
Fiery Body (Ex) The oil coating a hellstoker’s body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker’s oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.
Oily Hide (Ex) Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed.
Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker’s fiery body above for details.
