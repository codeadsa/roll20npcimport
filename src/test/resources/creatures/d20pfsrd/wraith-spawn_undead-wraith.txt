TACTICS
During Combat A wraith spawn concentrates attacks upon individual PCs, such as those caught in traps or at the edges of the group. If attacked, a wraith spawn flees and returns again to attack the same foe when it is safe.
Morale A wraith spawn flees if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, but if encountered in its home, it attacks until destroyed.
