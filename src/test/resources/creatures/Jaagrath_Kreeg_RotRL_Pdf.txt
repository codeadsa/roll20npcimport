TACTICS
During Combat Jaagrath is perhaps a bit overconfident in his fighting
prowess, but that certainly doesn’t mean he’s a pushover. He rages
on the first round of combat, then focuses his attacks on humans,
saving other races for “clean up.” On the first round of combat, he
makes full Power Attacks (+11/+6; 3d6+36/19–20/×3), but
if he misses he drops his Power Attack bonus by 5 points, and then
entirely if he continues to miss.
Morale If Jaagrath is brought below 25 hit points, he attempts to flee
to area B30 to recruit aid, drinking both of his potions as soon as
he gets a chance. Once at area B30, he fights to the death.
